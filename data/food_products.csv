1,"3.5 stars,  sadly not as wonderful as I had hoped","I bought this on impulse and it comes from Japan,  which amused my family,  all those weird stamps and markings on the package. So that was fun.  It said it would take about a month to arrive and it did take that long.  I was hoping for a more interesting taste but to our family,  it just tasted a bit less flavorful or weaker than the standard milk chocolate kit kat.  The green tea flavor was too subtle for the sugar and it just tasted sweet. The wafers were very crispy, and that was good,  but it tasted a bit anemic to us.I'm happy I bought it, but don't need to buy it again.",3.0
6,Available in some US stores,"I found these in a Mitsuwa Marketplace in Illinois.I actually expected them to taste better than the did.  they were okay but seem smaller than standard kit kats and the taste was a tad mild compared to other green tea candies I have tried.But still, they were pleasant enough and nice for a change.",3.0
9,Not a fan,"I love green tea, I love Kit Kats, but the two do not belong together. I hate the after taste of them.",1.0
14,Meh,I love Kit Kat & green tea....together they are okay.  Nothing to get excited about.  I wouldn't order this again.,3.0
20,Thai curry is the way to go to add spice to anything,"So many flavors. I can't begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries. I should ask them for recipes. Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I wanna say two and one half yogurts. It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry. Its all mashed in there. I cut a corner and take out  a little at a time. Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything. Veggies love it that are steamed, scrambled eggs, rice pasta and even fish and meat.",5.0
28,Delicious,"I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy (excluding the Panag) and various other curry pastes out there. Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps. The Red has more heat, but the green has more spice. The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste don't really have any heat to me, but do taste good as well.For a holiday treat, substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry. It is super delicious (just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so)",5.0
29,OK Product,"I like other styles of Mae Ploy curry paste, but the green just doesn't work for me. Overwhelming garlic, no heat, and very bland. I would not purchase this product again.",3.0
32,Not natural/organic at all,"This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative. They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this...I am &#34;returning&#34; item. I am trying to avoid my children's exposure to yellow 5, red 40 and so on...I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause. This may be fine for someone that doesn't read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family.",1.0
40,Small and not that great,"It's unfortunate that energy bars are shrinking, you have to eat two to feel like you ate anything.  This one wasn't that impressive.  Tasted to me like oats and raisins with side of peanut flavor.  High carb and not that high of content of anything good..basically a glorified, healthier granola bar.  Not worth the price in my opinion and I won't be repurchasing.  I've had much better.",3.0
46,They work well enough.,"There's a vague taste of apple cinnamon, but mostly I taste oats. I do love that these fill me up and keep me full for awhile. They are exactly what I needed.",4.0
48,Good tea,I bought this to compare it against Yogi Tea's &#34;Breathe Deep&#34; tea because of the lower cost.  It's pleasant enough but I prefer the Yogi Tea better.  This brand tastes good but seems to be less effective in clearing a cough or congestion than Yogi Tea.,3.0
49,Lessens the effects of an asthma attack,"If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all. If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quickly.We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful! It tastes great (I enjoy it  myself) and it is an effective breathing aid.**of course this is not medical advice, this N1 experience.",5.0
51,Mixed thoughts,"The taste of the breathe easy was ok, a little on the earthy side. I did find it cleared my lungs. However, I am prone to migraines and this set off a big one. I had to toss the 6 boxes I bought, ugh.",3.0
54,Dark Chocolate Toffee Nut - fantastic flavor! Great Amazon prices,"I really enjoy PowerBar ProteinPlus bars - but rarely buy them except when they are on sale. Purchasing them through Amazon is like having a sale everyday. I used the subscription for these PowerBars and reduced the cost even more. I have also purchased 2 other flavors.  The Toffee Nut arrived the quickest. I have many food sensitivities, and these products do not trigger them.  I feel vey happy to have them.",5.0
56,"Not very tasty, but good protein content","I wanted some extra protein for my workouts. Saw these on a gold box special at a great price and I bought them. I really don't like the taste, compared to other high protein bars I have tried, but they had great nutritional benefits. I would not buy these again though, due to the taste for me.",3.0
63,Nostalgia,"I was born in the 80's, and this was brought into class a few times. This is very good stuff, and is exactly how I remember it. It is however expensive. I ate the 10 pack within a day or two. I bought this to try out for long term food storage. They will last only a few years, which is expected because it's a dairy product.Definitely a comfort food, I will be stocking up more. LOVE IT",5.0
65,great,my niece teaches underprivileged kids in florida --- she had a science lesson and i sent her 3 boxes of this stuff --- most of the kids would never in their lives have had a chance to taste this stuff --- so for the price it was a good deal to share something that these kids would never have had...,5.0
75,Not soft at all. Basically same as cheap licorice but with stronger flavor.,"Licorice is my favorite candy, and it promotes good digestion. Since I have some digestive issues, I eat licorice on a regular basis. I've tried basically every brand. I bought this because it's advertised as soft licorice. However, it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor. The flavor is nice. The consistency and texture is terrible. I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale, but the next package was the same. I threw away both packages.",1.0
81,Panda licorice,"Panda licorice, There is not too much I can say about panda licorice It's very good that's why I keep on buying it.",5.0
82,Love this candy!,"This is an awesome product, natural, not a lot of ingredients, good flavor, not too sweet.But I no longer love our scaredy-cat friends at Amazon! :PNow they won't let you write honest reviews of the product, so lame.What's insane is the price! I can easily get this same thing at the grocery store for 1/3 to 1/2 the price (not even on sale).But here it's at a greatly inflated rate AND they've made it an ""add-on"" item - shameful.Add-on is the worst new ""feature"" I've seen in the many, many years that I've been shopping at this site.I am a Prime member & signed up for that so I could get FREE shipping on ANY item at ANY time - not so I would STILL have to group items into $25 & higher orders. Pathetic. Way to go Amazon. :PBUT - this is ABSOLUTELY the best licorice out there! Just be careful if you have high blood pressure: it uses real licorice as the main flavoring & licorice root can increase a person's blood pressure.OK, Amazon, will you chicken out & block my review again??",1.0
85,NOT gluten free,"As soon as I had a couple of sips, my eczema started uncontrollably itching. That's one of the signs when something I eat is NOT gluten-free. Will return the item for a refund.",1.0
93,Organic Vanilla Extract,"Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk.",3.0
94,Good stuff,This was good stuff but I just went thru it too fast. So I bought my last really large bottle at BJ's wholesale and it tastes the same and does the job.,5.0
99,Be aware of this produce,"The coffee does have a production date and best/use by date. Maybe I am the only one, but my purchase came back as quite close to the use by date, so just be careful. The coffee is good.",3.0
101,"Decent coffee, but ridiculously priced for not fresh coffee","I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.",3.0
102,Not worth it for the money,"First a little background on me. I Am a coffee drinking fiend. I probably keep several countries coffee production up, so I know coffee. I don't mind strong coffee or so so tasting coffee I just dont expect it to be expensive so so tasting coffee. I have had and love Jamaican Blue mountain coffee before but it was a lot more expensive than this. This came in a cute little burlap sack (you get some style points there) but after that it's pretty much down hill. The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price. I have ordered some more Blue mountain from another supplier will have to see how that goes. This is one that will not get any repeat business from me. There are plenty of other better tasting coffees out there at a lower price.",3.0
105,Great purchase,"I have been intrigued by the pour over coffee makers. We have a Bunn automatic that uses pour over and it produces a good cup of coffee, but I DH likes his coffee strong and thus the coffee is usually a bit bitter for my taste.  I usually stick to tea. Everything I have read says the manual pour over produces a strong but smoother coffee.I priced out various pour over cones and carafes, but the priced seemed high when we didn't even know if we would like it. I saw this Melitta at a great add on price($9 @ my purchase). It seemed perfect for a starter set. The cost was less than some of the other brands paper filters. The set includes the cone filter, the carafe, a lid and 5 paper filters- everything you need to try it out. I considered getting the larger one, but another reviewer noted that the coffee does not stay warm long and figured we would be better off with a size we could drink quickly.  While I was looking for a non-plastic cone, this is BPA free. The carafe is made in Germany, the cone top is made in Canada.Now to the coffee... It is fantastic!  I use the espresso grind that DH uses in the Bunn.  The coffee is just as strong without the bitterness. It doesn't seem to take any more time. I use the Hario kettle on our induction stove so boiling water takes no time. Then, the pour over is almost zen like. I mainly use this on my late mornings and on weekends. We may eventually upgrade to ceramic cone, but this suits our needs at present.",5.0
119,Really vibrant colors for just a little dye,"Yeah, this dye is tasteless as advertised!  I know there are already a million 5 star reviews but I thought I would join the chorus anyways. The dyes here are really vibrant and most importantly tasteless. This allows you to make really beautiful fondant cakes.  I literally put like 1 drop of this dye gel in about a 4"" ball of fondant and it came out the shade I wanted. The colors are pretty much full spectrum of the rainbow plus black. You can mix and match if you want to get more colors. I found it very easy to use. There are instructions on the box. I paired this with purchased fondant and made a very lovely orange, red, and black Halloween themed cake. I can't wait to use these again. For the price of less than $11, I feel like I got a good deal.",5.0
122,"A bit pricey, but cool if you're into cake decorating.","A bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.  And the colors provided can be combined to make any color your little heart desires.  Cool if you're into cake decorating.",4.0
134,Ingredients are unhealthy,"No way would I put the vast majority of the ingredients in these 'spice'  packs in my body..  As you know the list of the amount of anything in a product starts with the item it contains the most of and then the next most etc.  Try this for heart healthy,: Dextrose, sugar,salt,spices (doesn't say which ones) hickory smoke flavor, MSG, hyrolyzed soy protein, dehydrated onion,  dehydrated garlic,less than 2% of caramel color (what the heck for??), silicon dioxide and calcium silicate (anti-caking).  Then they list Cure ingredients:- salt (like they need more) and sodium nitrite (0.62^).As far as I'm concerned, this product should either come with a warning that it's not heart healthy or be taken off the market entirely.  I'm sure I can come up with practically the same taste without adding the junk.  Don't know if it's worth bothering to send back but I sure won't be using it.",2.0
146,Cinnamon Licorice powder,"this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.  I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby. If you want to go cheap off Amazon, you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder, 1.92-Ounce Bottle.  BTW ""star anise"" or ""aniseed"" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish.",2.0
149,Fabulous,I tried to find this spice and was unsuccessful. It is a great spice that I use not only in making Asian recipes but in many other dishes as well. I find it to be very versatile and an asset to my spice cupboard.,5.0
150,Strong licorice flavor,"This was ok - a bit strong on the licorice, so it is not the best that I have had.",3.0
153,never bought this,"never bought this so i cannot give a review at this timeso please stop asking me to review this item i ckeck mypantry and this is not in it,thank",3.0
156,MY FAULT - I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH 1 oz REALLY WAS - THE PICTURE FOOLED ME,"I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was. At $7.60, I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can. As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $3, but never used it fast enough so it would get old. I figured a powder would be better, so I can mix it as I needed it. When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can, I started looking for the hidden cameras ...  thought this HAD to be a joke. Nope .. and it's NOT returnable either. SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON. Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder.",2.0
157,Little Kick,I wish this had a lot more kick in it.  Flavor is ok.  Still trying to figure out what I should use it on.,3.0
158,kitchen supplies,I like HOT spices - so this is so I have - whan I want / need it - for that &#34;right taste&#34; !,3.0
162,Not good,"unsure if I just got a bad batch or what...the flavor has been bland and never builds to the expected pop of wasabi...followed the directions exactly, but just didn't get the results I was hoping for",1.0
163,Regularity,"I've used this product for years - not for 'dieting'; but for morning regularity.  I enjoy a cup of tea each night before bedtime, and am assured of daily 'relief'...  (lol).  I prefer the Apricot flavor;  but other flavor choices are available - depending on one's preference.  Purchasing thru Amazon has always been more cost-worthy, and shipping always prompt.",5.0
166,Painful cramps with this......,"Mother and I started drinking this back in the 1980's.  I stopped because it was causing me too much pain, slightly worse than menstrual cramps.  The herbs in this tea are strong.  I think I read somewhere where the Senna in this stimulates the bowels to contract.  This isn't really a weight loss product but more a laxative.",2.0
167,Love this tea!,This tea is excellent with a little vanilla stevia. Most effective if you take @ bedtime.. let bag soak for 10 minutes to get the most out of derinking it.,5.0
168,We lovingly call it poopy tea,This is a real aid to getting unstuck if you get my drift and we keep reordering time after time,5.0
169,Not up to expectations,English Breakfast tea is my go to morning drink.  It's smooth and subtle while providing the early caffeine boost.  Tazo's Awake version is sort of a letdown.  It doesn't taste as full as some of the other brands.  Not much different in taste and affect than a bulk store black tea.  I also got Tazo's earl grey which was better.  Overall not a bad experience but ill stick with more traditional brands for my black teas.,3.0
170,A Major Disappointment,"With its new-look packaging, Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend. The old blend was strong, robust, and biting. It was by far my favorite bagged black tea. The new blend is weaker and maltier; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea. If I want Lipton tea, I'll buy Lipton tea; it's a lot cheaper than Tazo.I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter. Tazo apparently decided that they'd gain more customers than they'd lose if they toned down the flavor. I don't know if they're right, but they've definitely lost me.",2.0
174,Flavorless and not that strong,"This brand of tea felt stronger in the past. Now it feels more ordinary.Relative to other teas I have consumed, this one has no flavor whatsoever. It is not even Organic, but that's okay as it was never advertised as such.I will not be buying it again.",2.0
177,Cinnamon & Ginger Tea,"Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves and star anise. These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially delicious.~The Rebecca Review",5.0
183,"Not for everyone, especially me.","The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether.The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes.Live and learn, I guess.",2.0
186,Where is the sweetness?,"Although it's called 'Wild Sweet Orange' I have yet to taste the sweetness. For the most part, it seems very tart to me. It's still a decent hot tea (and I bet it'd make a good iced tea too) but this really wasn't what I had expected.",3.0
189,My all-time favorite tea,"It's wintertime and there's nothing better than a hot cup of tea on a cold winter's day.  Tazo's ""Wild Sweet Orange"" has been a favorite tea of mine for almost 10 years now. I first got a sip of Tazo when we lived in Portland, OR and I learned from the natives that a hot cup of tea from a local vendor was better than a pair of gloves to keep you warm. I still love ""Wild Sweet Orange"" especially with just a hint of cinnamon to pick up the flavor.",5.0
191,A rather unusual tea experience.,"I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.Brewing it, it smells pretty intense. Drinking it, it tastes pretty intense. A very strong sour citrus flavor, coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture. After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was, and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix, to see if that improved anything.The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea, but rather, it coagulated into little clumps, making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd, and not improving the flavor in any significant way.Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea, but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations.",2.0
193,An absolutely delicious and full-bodied tea.,"I'm not a tea expert, but I know what I like, and this is it. This is a flavored black tea with notes of citrus and vanilla, a bit like panettone cake or King Arthur's ""fiore di sicilia"" flavoring. It's a bit similar to Earl Grey but without that resinous aftertaste and more of a vanilla undertone. Just in the canister, the tea smells perfumed and perhaps overly-flavored, but brewed, the taste of the tea itself becomes more prominent, making a dark, rich, full-bodied brew with an enchantingly subtle flavor profile. It takes a bit of milk handily without turning weak and watery, and re-brews nicely (though re-brews don't take milk as well). It chills well; I prefer it plain when it's cold. It tastes delicious with breakfast and also at any time of the day. Its ability to re-brew makes it more economical a choice, too.As black flavored teas go, this one's a keeper for me. I will definitely purchase it again and I recommend it heartily to tea drinkers.",5.0
213,FLAVOR DOESN'T LAST AS LONG...,AFTER CHEWING FOR SOME TIME THE GUM GETS STALE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE IT SHORTLY. OR MAYBE I JUST CHEW TOO FAST LOL NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE THOUGH. IT WAS AN ADD-ON ITEM.,3.0
216,Good price,Great for the car. Use in the office.Taste was fresh not stale./ Will order more when out due to the great price.,5.0
217,Why is the picture showing the 24 pack?????,"Misleading.  The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21.  Beware of misleading listings.Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 24)",1.0
218,Good,"It tastes good when chewing it but the flavor does not last long enough.  Other brands hold their flavor, this type after you chew it for a few minutes, the flavor vanishes away.",3.0
220,Love!,"Came right on time. By far my favorite gum that ORBIT carries! I don't need any of this tropical banana split nonsense! Straight up Spearmint will do the trick for me!It is a TINY BIT over priced... as I can get it at a store here for $10.99 a box... but hey, I love this gum so much that it doesn't bother me I paid an extra dollar per each box!",4.0
223,"Tastes great, texture sucks","I really like the cinnamon flavor of the gum, but that's about where the pros end. The gum was hard from the start, and I don't know if this is because it's too old or what. I don't mean like rock hard, but it's just too tough. The flavor lasts for maybe 10-15 minutes or so, so not great on that end either. It's just OK.",3.0
230,"Very tasty, long lasting and freshens your breath",I have been buying these from Amazon forever.  Very tasty and the sweetness lasts a long time.  It's also good after a meal as it helps freshen your breath and get the food out of your teeth.  But be very careful around your dogs as the sweetener in these is poisonous to dogs and perhaps other animals.,5.0
235,Is this a warehouse clearance item?,"The gum is hard unlike fresh stock available at local markets.This caveat is a bit weird:  &#34;Don't include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation&#34;So, I have to wonder if any of the initial reviews of a product are honest or goosed up for a payoff.",3.0
240,"Misleading description, but nice plant.","The first tree I ordered was badly scarred by wires.  The company replaced it quickly with a very nice tree that had a great shape.  The ficus is great if you have little natural light.  My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light.  That said, this is NOT a tree for beginners.  Ficus are notoriously finicky.  They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day.  Each time you vary the routiine significantly, it will drop all of its leaves.  Moreover, this plant was hard to water.  The pot doesn't have enough room for the water to soak in, so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience.  It needs to be watered daily.In short: good choice if you just don't have any good light, bad, bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel.",3.0

265,The Only One I Avoid.,"Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks.",1.0
270,"Unpleasant Heat, and No Flavor","O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews.  I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce!  This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs, soup, sandwiches, whatever.It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste.  The heat is derived from peppers and ""pepper extracts"" (read: capsaicin).If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere, try somewhere else.  I recommend Melinda's Naga Jolokia for one.",1.0
273,One drop only,"Someone sitting next to me at a tacqueria doused their taco with this stuff, just like regular piquante, took a bite, and then paid the price for the next twenty minutes.  Learning from his misfortune, I took a few tinefulls (on the tip of a fork) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended.  Just the perfect amount.  Two hours later, I still feel a nice lingering heat.As for flavor, I think serranos have a better flavor, but this wasn't bad.  I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of ""burn"".You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews.  This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food.  I don't know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff.",4.0
275,"Hot, hot, hot","Jolokia peppers are rated as the hotest peppers in the world.  This is a newer entry in the extreme hot sauce category and must be used with care.  I once gave a bottle of a slightly less hot Dave's Insanity Sauce to a friend who claimed he liked things hot.  He used it like he would use his normal hot sauce and almost set himself on fire.  This particular sauce should be used a drop at a time in chili or similar foods until you determine your tolerance.  Keep a cold drink nearby, and be careful not to burn a hole through your chair.",5.0
290,Maybe my taste buds are different.,"I just tried this sauce moments ago. Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was ""yuck"" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot. Just... hot, and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food. Also, the heat lasted only about five minutes or so, without me even drinking anything.",1.0
291,Good think it made me sick,"Never drink alot of this stuff.  I thought I was going to die.  Good think it made me sick, or I would have been burning the next day or so.",3.0
295,Kick to it,"I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a ""hottest sauce"" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.",4.0
296,Better than most super spicy sauces,"I put this in the category of 'super spicy sauces' - but - I don't think it is by any means too spicy.Flavor isn't too bad, a sort of smoky tomato base flavor.  More than anything, the heat comes through.This is pretty good for spicing up soups, chilies, etc.  However, not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something, not because it is too hot, just don't care for the flavor that much 'straight up.'All said, this is better than your average 'super spicy' sauce.  Most seem to just have the awful capsaicin extract flavor (and nothing else), which to me is inedible due to the terrible taste, not even the heat.  Dave's really isn't bad, but not my favorite either.",4.0

306,Love Dave's Gourmet Products!,I have been experimenting with different flavors using spices and herbs and other condiments.  I haven't had a lot of experience with different chili peppers so this was a great way to sample the chilies in a variety of forms.  I'd recommend it as a gift for novice cooks who like their food with varying degrees of heat.,5.0

313,Sugar Free Mapale Flavor Syrup,"Joseph's Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup is pretty good stuff for putting on Italian cakes or rolls. Sometimes I eat this at night and develop the worst form of gas anywhere. I can't help myself and have to let it ""out"" constantly, I don't know if something is in here that makes me act up. I was ejected from a concert hall after my stomach couldn't help itself. Just a warning to diabetics or regular sugar eaters, don't try to swallow the whole bottle in one sitting.",3.0
320,Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",1.0

325,Misleading Key Words - NO XYLITOL in this!,"I found this item by searching on Xylitol Maple Syrup...so when this turned up I made the mistake of assuming that Xylitol was the sweetener and did not check the description to see that it was solely Maltitol. Xylitol would have been a perfect sweetener, but I have had experiences with Maltitol and did not want to risk the intestinal disturbance, to put it mildly.  So now I am stuck with this item (which I will throw away) because Amazon says that this seller does not take returns.  Actually the postage to send it back would not have made sense, either.  So just make sure you were not looking forward to Xylitol.",3.0

337,Coffee and Famously Fabulous Fritters,"On a sultry July morning, a few years before Katrina blew into town, a friend and I wandered into the frenetic, powder-sugar dusted Cafe du Monde for an early cup of coffee and the famously fabulous fritters we had heard so much about. We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).Pefect patries and heavenly coffee.  Forget Starbucks!",5.0
339,So this is what French coffee tastes like???  Don't believe it!!!,Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example.  Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try.  Doesn't taste like coffee to me - but maybe should be called something else - something weak and not flavorful.,1.0
340,Better Than French Market!,"This is a much better Coffee than the French Market brand sole in our local grocery stores as chicory Coffee.  It tastes like a higher quality Coffee and it's just so much better once you try this brand of Louisiana coffee you'll never touch French Market again. This is a mellow, smooth yet strong Coffee with a pleasant after taste that you will enjoy how it lingers after you're finished with your last cup for the morning. French Market (it's only competitor) is bitter, too strong, the last cup in the pot is almost undrinkable, and you need to wash your mouth out with something with something that will get the bitterness out of your mouth it's so bad. I've on occasion used peppermint tea after one or two cups of French Market.Not with Caf&eacute; Du Monde, I can sit and drink an entire pot of this delicious Coffee and I love the lingering aftertaste. Weather with a typical breakfast, Donuts, Cereal or just plain toast this Coffee compliments the flavor of everything you eat. Just having it alone is like a treat!If you have been drinking French Market please try this brand and find out what you have been missing!",5.0
348,NOT sugar free!,"Product description says ""Mousse Mixes that are smooth, rich, creamy and sugar-free!"" There are actually 4g of sugar per serving.

It was a snap to make and enjoy after 2 hours of chilling. If I wasn't watching my sugar or carb intake, then I would gobble this up in a heartbeat. If you stick to the 1/2 cup serving recommendation, then you're consuming LOWER sugar/carb but 1/2 cup?? C'mon...",4.0

356,Consistant basic Mexican hot Chocolate you can dress up,"First off - this is not an ""instant' product the way most americans expect Hot Cocoa products to be.  It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder/blender.  It is a basic recipe which suits the majority.  Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.  Instant coffee will do in a pinch plus that's a good way to get rid of intsant coffee!It's best to try a few mugs of Ibarra before you decide to spice it up.  The flavor will grow on you. If you don't feel like paying the shipping fees, ask your grocer if they carry this item.  Most chain grocery stores with a Hispanic section do carry Ibarra.",4.0
360,My kids love this,"From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days.  This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk, break up one tablet, put milk and chocolate in blender, and blend approximately one minute.  I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days.",5.0

368,Beast of a Habanero Sauce - Amazing!,"I use this on Mexican dishes, rice, beans, etc.  I am a huge fan of Habanero sauces and this green sauce takes the cake.  I haven't found anything similar in quality or spiciness.  Highly recommend if it if you enjoy a nice hot green sauce.",5.0
370,Quite Hot -  If you want pure heat this may be your sauce. Yet there are even hotter ones if that is a priority,"This GREEN Habanero sauce is quite potent. Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Habanero Pepper, Salt, Acetic Acid (a chemical component of vinegar), .... etcConclusion: There is nothing special about this sauce beyond its considerable and concentrated heat. While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.A better choice would be the El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce. It is almost pure Habanero. It's major ingrediant is the Habanero pepper - not water. It is a bit hotter yet quite true to the pepper.If you decide to order this sauce --- Watch the seller's shipping charges which can often be excessive and won't drop even if you order multiple bottles at the same time.I'd pass on this hot sauce because of its lack of character - 3 stars is about right. But if you are looking for just pure heat then this sauce ALMOST hits that mark but the El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce is better in that regard.I'll confess I'm not a big fan of the Habanero pepper but you may be.Tastes do differ so you may want to try this one. In all fairness I gave it three stars because it offered pure heat without any obvious flaws.",3.0

It got some publicity so do a search for ""hot sauce lead"" to read up. Aside from the lead, the use of artificial colors also bugged me. The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process, such as washing the peppers, or not using salt from the earth, but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether. If they're not even washing the peppers before processing them, then they are probably covered in pesticides as well.",1.0

416,I made the mistake of eating Jell-o brand Mousse first,"I made the mistake of eating Jell-o brand NON sugar free first, so while this probably is awesome... after having had the Jell-o brand that is 120 calories a serving (but I make it with skim milk so it comes out somewhere less than that - maybe 100) This Sans Sucre stuff falls a little short on fullness of taste and texture.BUT... what I have taken to doing because I know this is so much better for me is I take a pack of this and a pack of the jell-o and I make two batches together at one time.. a double batch.  So I'm getting a little bit of the better texture and taste from the Jell-o brand but still saving a few calories.On it's own, the Sans Sucre is passable but really bland for me the taste is sweet but not full or rounded, because it's just hard when you're palate is used to the sugary fattening stuff.

My first impression, after grinding the beans fine, and making it in a drip coffeemaker, would be to not purchase this again.  I will try different grinds and see how that goes.  If it gets better I'll update my review.  I'll try Blue Horse Kona next. For over $30 this coffee should have been better.  You can find better blends at much lower cost.Update 1:  I tried a medium grind, rather than fine grind on this coffee.  The taste was more like hot water than anything else I might describe.Update 2:  Since trying this coffee, I have purchased Kroger brand Kona blend.  To me, these two taste very similar.  You can pay more than $30a bag for this or hit Kroger for the same taste and pay $6 per bag.  All in all, I become more disappointed with this Hawaii Roasterpurchase.",3.0

It doesn't matter what brand of flour, butter, eggs, sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap, it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap. This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron.

473,"Accidentally ordered instead of the vanilla extract, it's ok but prefer their extract","Nothing beats Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. Once you've used it, all other vanillas seem weak or watered down in comparison. I've been using this brand exclusively for at least 5 years now. However, I always order their Vanilla extract & didn't even realize they offered a 'paste'.I wasn't looking closely when I ordered this and was surprised when I opened this and found it was a thicker, gel-like substance. My first concern was ""will it taste as good?"" followed by ""what is being used to thicken this stuff?"". The taste seems pretty equivalent and according to the label, a tsp. of this is equal to a tsp. of their vanilla extract. The thickener used is Gum tragacanth, which if you wiki it shows as being a gum from a middle eastern tree.Personally, I'd prefer to cook with stuff that doesn't have added thickeners, colorings, artificial flavorings etc., so going forward I will be sure to check the label and order the extract. However, I didn't see anything about the gum tragacanth to make me want to toss this bottle out and not use it at all.I do not think this has better or more intense flavor than the Nielsen-Massey Vanilla extract although others here have claimed this. You do see the little bits of vanilla bean in the gel/paste, so if you like that ""look"" of vanilla bean specks in your ice cream, cake or whatever you're making then this will give you that. However, taste wise, it's not better plus you're adding a tree gum to your food.All-in-all I'll stick with the same brand vanilla extract going forward, but would be willing to order this paste again if their extract weren't available (because the taste of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla is far superior to every other vanilla I've used in the past (including home-made).",3.0

I love that it is not a thin liquid but more of a thick, syrup consistency, so when added to anything you are baking (especially in quantities that are over and above the quantity called for in a recipe, which is a must for me) it does not alter the end product the way traditional thin vanilla extract does. In addition, like all Nielsen-Massey vanilla products, it has a robust vanilla flavor. Accept no cheap substitute. This is worth the price; your taste buds will thank you.",5.0

502,How to ruin a three year old's birthday,"Perhaps I should've looked more closely at the picture, but with my seasonal allergies, my contacts were blurry and I thought I was just looking at a very short haired hare. My three year old son wanted a rabbit for a pet, so I ordered this for his birthday. Overnight shipping, of course. I'm an animal lover and member of PETA, and I ALWAYS order my pets with overnight shipping. Especially during the summer.When they say ""fresh"" I think they need to be more clear about what that means. I also think they need to look up ""whole"" in the dictionary, because as my son pointed out between crying jags, this rabbit is definitely missing some of the more adorable pieces.While I'd normally give this a one star rating for ruining my son's birthday, I'm going to add two stars because it WAS indeed delicious: delicate and nutty in flavor.",3.0

507,Thumper Rabbit RIP,"**Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward ""Eddie"" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.""Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?""  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. ""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.",3.0

552,Good,"One male Amazon reviewer here stated that dandelion root reduced the inflammation in his foot.  I liked his story so much I gave this tea a try because I felt I suffered from inflammation as well, although it involved the nasal passage.  After finishing more than half the package, having three cups of dandelion tea a day for more than a week, I have to attest to the fact that it did little more than give me hope.  I enjoyed the tea.  It did not have a bitter or odd taste, not to me.  I drank it hot without honey.  It was a bit of a diuretic and I felt it gave me a bit more energy somehow, but it did not make a noticeable difference in my cold-like symptoms related to mucous and my nose.  I am only reporting my experience, not a scientific test and I certainly don't know if dandelion tea is even supposed to work with nose inflammation and colds.I liked the tea and enjoyed drinking this tea more than drinking black or green tea or even Earl Grey tea.  I will keep a stock of dandelion tea on hand now that I've enjoyed the experience of it.  It probably does have good medicinal uses, though not for what I have.",3.0

565,Poor quality tea full of sharp hay-like bitter stems,"I bought this on a lightning deal and am very disappointed. If you want (bagged) high quality chamomile tea, stick to all-flowers, high-quality potent Traditional Medicinals brand. This produced-going by their exact instructions and a couple of variations-a browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce (darker in this case does NOT mean potent-chamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations, never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration), and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet apple-cherimoya tastes than any good chamomile.While I do tend to brew loose tea&am; picky about the actual bags used by any given brand (chemical bleaching will destroy all tea), bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea. Still, I won't be taking this anywhere-the two unused boxes will go to a food bank since I'm sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine. Frankly, Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita single-ingredient options I purchased.One thing I tend to do with every new tea  try is analyze the actual tea itself, always wet but often dry as well. This one's prominence of stems (a 1.5cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with), the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowers-very poorly handled ones!-and the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere. If you want bagged tea, Traditional Medicinals' chamomile--which is all flower, twice as flavor (and nutrient)-rich as Alvita gram for gram, and can be steeped essentially indefinitely(til the bag breaks down) without becoming bitter, which is true of nearly all pure chamomile(that isn't treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc), especially Egyptian varieties-- is so far the best I've found. Two bags of this cannot compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woody-tannins and other bitter components are from the stems, not the flower.If you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work, getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess (including how long they've been sitting around) is by far your best bet-cheapest, too, and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled double-layer mesh strainer for a few dollars-I personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden (in this case-iodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out) liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or pu'ehr steep again without too much awkwardness.The tl;dr essence of this: look elsewhere-this is extremely poor chamomile, whether you ask me, a diligent grower, or an expert-this is not advertised as twiggy tea (it'd be the wrong component anyway) and you likely aren't looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to hay-like splintery stems.

Then, voila, I find Alvita on Amazon.  Done.",5.0
584,Good value,"I usually dont compare down to this degree for something like this, but since I had it both available, I did a direct side-by-side taste test (subjective) at home with another brand offered by Amazon,Traditional Medicinals Organic Roasted Dandelion Root, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). As for the Alvita brand, my senses tell me...Smell: Good! Same nutty aroma that resembles roasted tahini, or peanut brittle.Color: Medium brown, with some reddish tone. Not as dark as Traditional Medicinals.Taste: Good, but not the best I've tasted. Initial flavor like some kind of nutty coffee drink is all there and good, just not as rich. There is also a very slight tang aftertaste.Differences aside, this is a great healthy tea that supposedly promotes healthy liver function. I started drinking this last time I got a caution that my liver enzymes were boderline high. I have yet to confirm that it helped, but the psychological benefits are helping a bit ;). It tastes good, and somewhat resembles hot coffee in the morning, only more healthier.On a comparitive note, the tea bags themselves are cheap. They do not have draw strings like most tea bags have, they are not individually sealed or wrapped, and they come grouped together in a non-resealing package. If this doesn't effect you that much, then I would recommend this buy because you get more tea bags for your money. Otherwise, I think you will get a better experience with Traditional Medicinals. As a final tip, with either brand, the more you steep the more flavor comes out.",4.0
585,Interesting taste,"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!",3.0

So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled ""Stimulant Laxative."")So what works for me?  Lots of the high-fiber foods every day.  Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways.Nature is great.",1.0

Also Amazon needs to offer a Zero star option as that is what I would give this new version-a big fat zero.,1.0
619,Misleading...,"This is refined not unrefined. How amazing, the seller will not provide the proper images of the product after complaint. I had to return due to misrepresentation by the seller.Spectrum is an organic producer which sells refined as well as unrefined VCO in many different labellings, different containers, glass to plastic. Spectrum VCO are identified as Essentials but for cooking it is identified as Naturals.I use VCO in the mix for my hair, shaving cream, soap, hand lotion, face lotion, body lotion, tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients. Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level. Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil, no more extra virgin. In Canada where the best VCOs are produced, it is illegal to even use the term, extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed. There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil, only virgin, there is no pure, no #1, no 100%, no premium liquid, or any of those terms used for coconut oils. There is no coconut oil especially produced for beauty product which is any different than for cooking or consumption either as a salad dressing or right out of the jar with a spoon. The higher the grade, the higher the nutrients, everything else are marketing tools to sell coconut oil for more money.REFINED or UNREFINED: The decision to choose between refined vs. unrefined is dependent upon the intention or use of the oil. Unrefined coconut oil has a smoke point of 280 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas, refined coconut oil's smoke point is 365 degrees Fahrenheit making it great for high heat cooking or saut&eacute;ing.GRADE A: Unfiltered, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Canada Organic, BC Certified Organic, Ecocert, first pressed VCO and Kosher.

729,Out of This World...,"This is a very delicious, pure, true raw USDA organic honey.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for ""ultrapurified,"" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin.

759,"Toothsome condiment, absurdly overpriced.","This substance is quite a bit like Vegemite (one reviewer here makes a point that it's not: I'm not sure he tasted both, otherwise why make such an obviously absurd statement? Vegemite is a tad smoother, but that's all).The consistency and colour are a bit like chocolate mousse but much thicker. It is a bit softer than Vegemite though. The predominant flavour is salty, with a noticeable aftertaste of bitter, and a hint of smoke and beer. Ignore the promotions that suggest it's a spread: it is most certainly not a spread -- if you spread it on a slice of bread like jam or butter, you'll vomit: it's too bitter in such a huge quantity. Better do this: spread some nice butter on your bread, generous amount, and then add no more than quarter teaspoon of this thing. You don't have to spread it: me, I just scoop it from the bottle and eat. Take a bite out of your bread, and then 1/4 tsp of Marmite directly off the spoon. Or you can try to spread it, but it's thicker than butter and it'll be hard to smother it evenly over butter, it'll clump and remain in one place (too much of it). A small amount does it, don't gorge, it's a strong flavour. It also works great with zesty greens, like arugula, for example. Well, there isn't much else to say: it's great stuff, and I can heartily recommend it.Don't listen too much to the talk of its being an ""acquired taste"", only for the Brits, etc. It's a normal condiment that all people will like, I believe. Which brings me to one very significant moment: it's absurdly overpriced. I would put it in the same category as, say, soy sauce, or salsa, and it should cost about the same too.Btw, don't get it here, get it locally: it's a bit more expensive but there's no shipping, so the overall cost will be much lower. I get it in Whole Foods, for the obscene seven/forty-nine a small jar (but it's less than overall here though), or, when they have it (not always), at Wegman's, for the less-unreasonable four/ninety-nine. Good stuff, but needs to be much cheaper, when will Unilever come to their senses? I think a fair price for Marmite would be like, say, three dollars for 250 grams (and it shouldn't be sold in such small jars either: 250 grams is the smallest that'd make sense, 'cause like it is, I finish it off, alone, in less than two days and have to go buy another jar). In my view, Marmite should come in 250 gram, half a kilo, and a kilo packages -- and cost a fraction of what it costs right now. It's even more expensive than Vegemite (who is available at Wegman's, for about six bucks at the time of posting). These two similar products are quite agreeable, but six to eight bucks a tiny jar is way too much, it's an insolence really. I can't give good rating to this product in view of these prices, therefore: product itself is five stars; prices one star: our overall rating here is therefore three stars.",3.0
762,A savory secret,"I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back. My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldn't afford eggs and bacon. The Mr said it was made from a by-product of beer, I thought he was joking at first.  Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast, served properly, he demonstrated then handed to me. It was surprisingly strong but I liked it. Savory [or savoury as they would spell it] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease. It's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web, so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread, often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato.",5.0
772,"Great product, lousy packaging","I was tempted to give this fewer stars, but it wouldn't be fair to blame the product for Amazon's poor packaging. Lyle's Golden Syrup is an outstanding and delicious syrup. If you make any kind of traditional English desserts, there is no substitute. If you simply use it in place of corn syrup, you'll never be satisfied with anything else again. I can only say: taste it. It speaks for itself, and it's immediately obvious that this isn't just something you use to add sweetness. It has a distinctive and delicious flavor all its own and will enhance any recipe where it can be used. Or, just dribble it with butter on muffins or toast. Divine!  Now, as for Amazon's packaging: terrible!  This product comes in a sturdy tin that could probably be stepped on by an elephant without being harmed, and yet Amazon packed it so poorly that it arrived half caved in and pretty useless. Because it's a small and not expensive item, I won't go to the trouble of returning it - but I'll find another source to buy it rather than Amazon. This is carried by many specialty stores and health food stores.",5.0

They arrive dumped in a plastic bag, which has been dumped in a box and dropped from a great height. For the kind of shipping they want it would be reasonable to expect a better presentation.

810,Possible dangerous / deadly toxic reactions to product if used in quantities greater than .5% of total food or liquid volume,"This Thanksgiving I went to my sisters, she made gravy with Zanthan Gum.  Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction; my face looked like a puffer fish, my heart was racing, vertigo, my tongue started to swell,  I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsed.The packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning (as it should!) about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than .5% of total volume of food or liquid.  The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris.  Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients, and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified, dried, powdered, and sold as xanthan gum. (Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food, doesn't it?)In other words, xanthan gum is an industrial processed product--  It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process--a chemical. There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA's ongoing investigations. Currently, there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it, the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed, resulting in deaths.FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive's safety. It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly.  We'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry. As a thickener, it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function. Drilling fluid serves several purposes, including cooling the drill bit, providing hydrostatic pressure, and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten, something else is added in it's place.  FInd out what and how safe it it is - better yet, just avoid any foods with Gluten if you do have Celiac's disease.  Shortcuts are rarely quite as simple as them may seem in my experience.",1.0

Well someone is not doing the right thing cause yeast extract is on the label and it admits it is not organic, but the front is miss leading! They will not refund your money only sent you more product.  This is their email to me in regards:Good afternoon Danielle.Thank you for your email.  MSG was first produced from a seaweed broth in 1908, and today disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate can both be produced from fish or dried seaweed &#8211; although typical production of these ingredients now uses different raw materials. These flavor enhancers often work in conjunction with MSG to create a more complete flavor profile.It is important for you to know that our product does contain some MSG.  Although we do not add any MSG to our Better that Bouillon line of products, they naturally contain MSG from the ingredients we use.  MSG comes from the common amino acid glutamic acid, and glutamic acid is naturally present in our bodies, as well as in many foods and food additives.  Since glutamic acid is naturally occurring in all protein, I am not aware of a chicken broth or base that does not contain at least some natural MSG.  Of course, as you can see on our label, we do not add any additional MSG to our products.MSG has been a hot topic in the food industry for years.  Because it is a high profile ingredient, MSG has been studied extensively by the FDA as well as independent researchers.  In fact, the FDA commissioned a study on MSG in the 1995 to specifically answer the question whether MSG was safe as a food ingredient.  The study came to the conclusion that MSG was safe.  Results of this study can be found on the FDA website.[...]The term ""natural flavor,"" ""natural flavoring,"" ""flavor"" or ""flavoring"" means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product or roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portion of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.We appreciate and value your business.Kedra AndersonCustomer Service Coordinator|Customer Service DepartmentSoutheastern Mills, IncPhone 706-378-6561800-334-4468 ext 6561Fax  706-378-6578Email  kanderson@semills.comHigh Performance Work Placecid:image003.png@01CEEB65.908BAC20",1.0

957,ARTIFICIAL TASTING STUFF,"I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey.  Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like.  I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this.  To each his own taste, though.  I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers.",1.0

Additional Riboflavin (B2) and Cyanocobalamin (B12) are added after fermentation along with Thiamine (B1), Pyridoxine HCL (B6), Niacin and Folic Acid. Infact what this bag contains yeast and supplements, where I could care less for unregulated business for supplements.Frontier is a superb brand but no need to consume supplements.

Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me.

There are apparently no health risks, it's much sweeter than sugar, all natural (just Stevia and xylitol from the birch tree) and in the case of Stevita Supreme, it's much cheaper than Splenda or Equal (at least on Amazon). The problem is that, with some beverages, the bitter stevia aftertaste still comes through. I can't really taste it when I'm using it to sweeten punch or sprinkle it on fruit, but in coffee and tea it's definitely there. It's not so bad that it makes in undrinkable, but it's certainly something that you should be aware of before purchasing it. Then again, all artificial sweeteners seem to have an aftertaste, and I prefer Stevia's herbal bitterness (when detectable) to aspartame's artificial tang.

1406,"New delivery has stale, nasty taste?",My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years.  We have always used the medium roast.  On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old.  Very nasty.  The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I don't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods.  These are so bad we can't even drink them.  I'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig.  VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old.,1.0
1414,No longer cost effective; too expensive for what you get,"The Senseo pods are no longer a cost effective way of getting a quality cup of coffee. Looking through my order history, ""Back in the day"" a couple of years back this six pack of 18 pods used to hover around eighteen bucks; now it is double that. So I got curious and I cut a pod and compared it against the content of a K Cup - the Senseo pod contains about half the coffee of a regular KCup. This means one has to use two Senseo pods to match the strength of a KCup for the same size brew. This translates to Senseo being more expensive than an average K Cup bought in quantity here at Amazon.Maybe I got used to the coffee, but the Senseo pods no longer produce the bold aroma and taste that got me hooked a few years back; I defected to Keurig where I found a much richer variety and I don't regret it for a second. On the contrary, I stopped having this nagging feeling of being ripped off by the constantly increasing price of these pods.",1.0

What taste it has is horrible...not that there is much taste at all!  I will struggle through this case and never buy it again!  All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or evening...a GOOD cup of decaf!  Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so!  I wouldn't recommend this stuff to my worst enemy!  Again, I say YUCK!Also, my tummy's reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the pods...perhaps in the glue?  I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they wouldn't give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME!  Forget it!  That made me even more suspect!I can't say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere.

1435,surprisingly... good,"Okay... so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees. The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast. It's not that the roast itself was bad, it just tasted ""flat"" - none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods - and I was sorely disappointed. However, I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time, having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal, but the best machine - and then... when all hope seemed lost... a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast. This stuff is good coffee people! You can taste the nuances and hints of floral, chocolately, nutty, and all those other words that go with describing good coffee... so I highly recommend these pods. They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins... FIVE STARS!!!",5.0
1439,"Full-bodied, but harsh!","Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system, and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods. Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee, and even though I'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee, I can drink that with just dairy, no sugar. I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee--and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee. It was so bitter I almost couldn't drink it. It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt. And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.The problem was, I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process (the Toddy's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter, less acidic, less caffeinated coffee than normal) or the coffee brand. So, I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods (2 to a pack, very inexpensive) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy. It tasted slightly weak, oddly; however, it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee. If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees, which I don't, I think you'll enjoy it. But if you have acid stomach problems or just don't like bitter coffee, I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo.",2.0

Just opened my first of six bags, so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my ""bargain"" purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional.

Another favorite is Baronet French Roast decafe from Amazon.,3.0

1467,"Good coffee, but do watch out for differing batches","OK so most people seem to like this coffee; it's got a strong rating (4 1/2 at the moment), but there are still those that say they don't. It will always be subjective; many people detest Starbucks coffee, but millions more like it. Some like it bold, some like it weak, some like it mild, some like it bitter, some like it sweet; no way to please everyone.This coffee is on the mild side, meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering, and is moreso on the sweeter side, meaning it's not bitter like diner-house coffee. The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee; because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor, it compliments most flavored creamers. I've had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers, and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends. The senseo medium roast so far has been the best ""starting point"", meaning nobody I've personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it. Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee, but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee. I use a single pod in approx. 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water, and it turns out great.One other thing, sometimes batches taste 'slightly' different from one-another; it's a product from a plant when all is said and done, and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste, sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another, it happens with all manufacturers (including Folgers and other large manufacturers, which I've personally tasted radical variations). I've ordered this 6-pack around 6 times so far, and only one batch was slightly odd tasting (had a much more noticeable/bitter flavor to it), other than that it has been very consistent. I left the bag slightly open on that batch, in essence making it ""go flat"" so it wasn't so bitter. While these packets are sealed, make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavor.One other thing to watch out for: increasing costs. This pack is still a great deal on Amazon, but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well. I still love this coffee, but if it goes up to $40 for a 6-pack of this, I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase. Keep it low in cost and at the same level of flavor and we'll all be happy.",5.0

They are two small crackling cookies per wrapper and they are a crunchy shell of delight. The taste is strangely addictive, after having a few I couldn't stop thinking about them! I have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one. They taste like the holidays, spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond. They flavor is royal and time stopping, on busy days, one bite of this cookie and I am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to Italians for years.Incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee, tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with.

This is NOT the same thing as fermenting a batch of kimchi for days at room temperature so that those wonderful fermentation bubbles build up and render the special ""tang on the tongue"" that I realized (after making this) is critical to good kimchi.I also found the flavor strange, too sweet and also a little ""off"" in a way I cannot describe. I didn't weigh my cabbage, but I selected a standard-sized Napa head so it had to be in the ballpark of four pounds. But the flavor of the packet overwhelmed the cabbage completely. I wound up rinsing off as much as I could, then stuffing the cabbage back into a mason jar and putting it under airlock on the counter to see if I can salvage the batch. The verdict is still out.I'm not a kimchi purist or connoisseur, but I know enough to know this isn't what I like.

I wanted an organic chai, since I found out my other chai didn't do so well when it came to pesticide residues, so I switched to this, and it's nice I didn't have to give up flavor.  This is delicious- spicy, but not overwhelming. And unlike some Chais, I find it balanced.  In some only one spice predominates- I find this one to have many flavors.",5.0
1646,Strong Bergamot Perfume,"***This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.***",3.0

Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.

1686,Organic Nutmeg...,"Nutmeg is rich in protective anti-inflammatory compounds that can lower your risk of cancer by stifling tumor growth. Macelignan the compound in nutmeg fights the germs which reduces plaque formation by 50 percent and eradicates cavity-producing microbes. This is not saffron. Saffron is very, very expensive and comes from Iran. Nutmeg is from Malaysia and Indonesia. For purity place some in water. If water turns into a murky color then it is diluted since real nutmeg will turn water yellow. In small quantities nutmeg is safe, but in higher quantities, nutmeg is very poisonous and toxic. Nutmeg has been used as a drug in other countries and indulgence can cause a slew of adverse effects. I use it in moderation and try to get the whole nut and grind it myself. In my big dishes, I just throw in the nut, no grinding. Nutmeg has a very strong and distinctive taste.Spice Hunter is sold everywhere so prices varies considerably. This is a good brand in organic form. Powders always lose the taste and smell sooner than the whole nut regardless of the food item but grinding may be a challenge for such a hard nut.",5.0

Their sprouts germinated/sprouted excellent and were super tasty.My last order, however, was purchased from Buy Wholesale Cheap.  They are way too cheap.  Those get zero stars.  The products should not even be under the same heading.  Theirs came in what amounts to a heavy-duty sandwich bag.  This cheap bag also split, and the seeds were everywhere -- all over my porch and in my garage.  In fact, the post office delivered the box several days late in a large, black plastic trash bag (see customer image).To my eye, the seeds from Buy Wholesale Cheap also did not look the same as those from The Sprout House either.

1745,WARNING - AMAZON HAS TAKEN REVIEWS FROM SPROUT HOUSE AND MOVED THEM TO TODD.,"I wrote a review for Sprout House brocolli seeds in 2009.  That review is below.  I have never ordered seeds from Todd's.  Seed quality varies greatly for many reasons including the storage and shipping conditions and the age of the seed. I don't know whose fault it is that my review of Sprout House Seeds which are excellent ended up under Todd's seeds.  Todd has said that he has requested that this issue be corrected but that Amazon has refused.I am leaving this review here to alert you to the fact that all reviews posted under Todd's seeds relating to a product reviewed before early 2010 cannot be referring to Todd's company.  Todd did not start selling organic broccoli seeds on Amazon until early 2010.  In addition, any reviews referencing a product bought from Sprout House would not be applicable to Todd's Seeds.INITIAL REVIEW:I am very happy with these seeds.  High yield, in my opinion relatively mild flavor for broccoli sprouts and Rita the Sprout Lady at Sprout House provides cheerful, great, fast service. If you eat broccoli sprouts or want to, sprouting your own is the way to go.  Much less expensive than buying the sprouts at the grocery store and the quality of your own sprouts will be superior - much fresher and crisper.UPDATE: April 27,2011.  I had some leftover broccoli seeds that I kept in the refrigerator for two years from Sprout House.  They are still sprouting well and are delicious.  They just take a little longer to get going than when they were first purchased.FOLLOW UP REVIEW WHEN MY SPROUT HOUSE REVIEW STARTED APPEARING UNDER TODD'S SEEDS:UPDATE: August 11, 2011.  The seeds I bought were from Sprout House.  I continue to buy from Sprout House.  Amazon should not have placed my review under seeds from an entirely different vendor.  Not all seeds are equal.",1.0

1766,Great for the taste and for the throat,"L&auml;kerol licorice pastilles from Sweden are a firm but chewy little button with a strong traditional licorice flavor. The ones in the red box have a distinct menthol taste, which seems to go really well with the taste of licorice. Flavored with xylitol, they are almost calorie free at just 3 calories per pastille. Moreover, they are not just great for flavor. This itself would be enough of a reason to pop one in your mouth from time to time. But they are also good for the throat. Licorice is soothing to the respiratory system. (Many traditional European cough syrups have a licorice base.) And L&auml;kerol, with its strong dose of licorice extract, is no exception. They also are good for the breath. A couple of these pastille last a long time in the mouth and provide the licorice lover with a long-lasting licorice taste.",5.0

This is not really for mature skin, I had to reapply repeatedly and it felt my hands feeling clammy and stinking of baby food and I'm only twenty six.

However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value.

1942,"Works pretty well, especially for ticks","I have two Maltese dogs and was at my wits end when I found this product.  The people behind me had brought in two puppies, covered with ticks, and promptly shared them with the entire neighborhood.  Nocturnal visits by cats, plus several squirrels running around in my yard, brought in fleas, and I could NOT get rid of them.  Maltese dogs have really long, thick hair and my poor little dogs were just miserable.  I had to have all their hair cut off (which I usually do in the summer) in the early spring, while it was still very cold at night and in the morning.  And I STILL couldn't get rid of the fleas and ticks.  My male dog is allergic to Advantix and Frontline didn't even slow the ticks down.  So I was looking for some other kind of help when I found this product.  I had heard some people say it worked and others said it didn't, but I decided it was worth a try and I'm really glad I tried it.  It doesn't get rid of every flea or tick on my dogs, but, where I was finding a bunch of fleas and picking ticks off my dogs by the dozens, every day, I am now finding an occasional flea and maybe one or two ticks on my dogs every day.  My little girl dog is a big eater and she loves to eat her pill.  My finicky-eater boy has to have his crushed and dropped into his mouth.  Once it's there, he likes it pretty well and will go ahead and swallow it.  Bottom line:  it worked pretty well for my dogs and there is no garlic smell that I can detect.  I think it was well worth the money.",4.0
1945,Made my dog really thirsty,I've only been giving my poodle mix (15 lbs.) these capsules for like two weeks now but I'm already considering stopping them. They haven't really done much to help the fleas and I think they might be harming him because he's been drinking too much water. On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night. I'm worried that the pills might be affecting his kidneys so I think I'm going to stop giving them to him. That's too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good. Although I did see some possitve changes in him it hasn't been enough to outdo the possible negative consequences. I also read that brewers yeast can cause bloating so I'm not sure this is such a good idea after all. Has anybody else experienced this?,2.0
1954,tastes great(according to my dog),"My rough collie loves them, and she is the pickiest eater I've ever seen.  Half the treats I buy she won't touch, so I was skeptical about giving her brewers yeast no matter how good for her it might be.  Needless to say I was amazed that she likes these tablets more than any of her other treats.  Collies can be prone to skin problems and allergies to fleas, in fact we had to put a big male collie when I was young who lost half his hair to hot spots.Since my collie can get infested with fleas because of the matting of her undercoat(which happens on a daily basis), I've been looking for something besides the flea drops that make her lethargic for a day after I apply them.  She doesn't have any fleas at the moment and now I'm hoping to keep her that way with brewers yeast.  So far, so good.  Unfortunately, the cat doesn't like them, so she'll be getting the back-of-the neck drops.I feed my 55 lb. collie about 5-10 tablets almost every day.  They make very convenient treats and they're small enough for one bite.  It's been a few weeks now and her coat looks terrific, but then it alway does.  I'm going to keep feeding her brewer's yeast for the rest of her life and hopefully, we'll stay flea-free.",5.0

I live in the woods and bugs are a problem or should I say they were a problem.Giving this is not hard my dog loves them I do not have to crush them to give them I just have to shake the container and wherever he is he comes running.Because of this product I no longer need to use those awful drops you must put on their backs to repel bugs, this is a safer better way to keep your pets bug free.UPDATE:If your pet has any yeast infections going on stay away from this product.  Some claim it helps with yeast but as I found out just recently yeast is yeast and all yeast may cause yeast infections in sensitive dogs.  Like mine.  I can no longer use this product, they claim on the label it hels with skin problems and since yeast causes skin problems I assumed this would hlep, It does not it makes it worse.",4.0

1995,Its amaranth..,"If you have used amaranth before, all you need to know is that this is good quality clean amaranth.  Buy it if price suits you.If you have never used amaranth before, be aware these are very very tiny seeds.  When you cook them they form a sort of crunchy paste.  Sort of an amaranth polenta...  Very subtle flavor.Not my favorite grain but I kinda liked it when cooked for ten minutes at pressure in pressure cooker with equal amount millet and couple whole medium large unpeeled white potatoes.  I cook my grains in stainless bowl that sets inside the pressure cooker on the rack.  This keeps such things from scorching or sticking to bottom of cooker and makes clean up much easier since nothing sticks to cooker itself.  You just remove the stainless bowl to wash it.  The steam in the pressure cooker really fluffs up grains.  By way, best method to cook rice!You need like inch water in bottom of cooker, then in the bowl, cup and half of water per cup of grain (or beans).  So in this case three cups water to the one cup millet and one cup amaranth.  Cook at 15psi for ten minutes.  When cooking done and pressure naturally released, mash up potatoes with fork and stir everything together with a measure of olive oil and bit salt or your favorite spices, garlic, diced veggies etc.  Serve hot.  The potato and millet keeps the amaranth from being just lump of crunchy paste.  IMHO potato flavor also goes very well with grains and/or beans.",5.0
1996,I am not sure about this,I thought I was getting amaranth flour.  It is still in grain form so you have to find a way to grind it.  I do not know for sure if this is something I like.  The flavor is a bit strong for me.  So I am not sure if I am just cooking with it the wrong way.,5.0

This grain cooks up like cream of wheat or malto meal, however, the smell is horrible.....kinda musky, kinda earthy, downright off-putting. I tried masking this with cinnamon and vanilla. I tried mixing the grain with steel cut oats. No matter what, the pungent and specific smell of amaranth overpowers the taste and any enjoyment of the product.

Flax seeds sells never sells for $20.94 a bag as claimed by the seller. It seems that the seller keeps changing the sale numbers in order to sell a product. Arrowhead is an excellent brand with many great organic products where others fail to produce in organic form but this approach is just misleading and not necessary at all.*****************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/11/2013Seller claims;List Price: $40.61Price: $8.24 ($0.04/oz) & FREE Shipping on orders over $25You Save: $32.37 (80%)That is misleading. No flax sells for $40 a pound. At $8.24 a pound it is 824/16=51.5 infact something like more than $0.51 cents an oz not $0.04 an oz. Arrowhead is a good brand but the seller is misrepresenting the facts.*****************************************************************************************************************************MISLEADING LABELING: sprinkle a tablespoon of ground seeds... 14oz not 16 oz since it is golden not brown.It is shame that Arrowhead with so many fine organic products will misguide consumers just to sell a product. In the beginning there was only one color flax which was brown but now there is golden as well. Usually in organic form except in supplement form, the farmer co-up flax or any type of seeds are always more expensive due to their practices which is not sold on Amazon at all. Brown and golden have the same nutritional value so I never consume one, I mix brown and golden regardless. In some cases Golden is more expensive than brown. If not specified on the labeling the type of flax, then it means brown flax not golden flax.OILS: I started consuming flax oil years ago per my physician's advise not knowing that majority forms of flaxseeds are rancid and absolutely worthless due to oil in seeds. As whole, human body cannot digest any seed that size with that consistency regardless if it is flax, sesame, amaranth, chia, millet, etc. unless cooked or in ground form since human body cannot digest in its natural form. As SUPPLEMENT, TABLET FORM, OIL, POWDER, GROUND IN BAGS are all worthless and hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. Rancid is a process of Mother Nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed. Advising consumers to purchase different brands of flax in oil form or powder or tablet form are all marketing tools as well. It is not important even if the oil or the tablet or the powder in bags are even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the type or brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed and air will get to the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if you keep the rice in a sealed container, wrapped in the most elaborate sealing containers in the world regardless. Chia is the only seed that claims it does not need to be ground but that is a marketing tool just like the price of chia is since it comes from outside US and individuals without any knowledge about nutrition always associate those as superior for exotic reasons and pay a hefty price for a food item with less nutrients. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed. After many years of consuming seeds, I chose to ground all seeds myself and seal immediately, kept in freezer and consumed within few days which I am very happy with the results since after all looking fit and well is just result of training hard and living a healthy lifestyle which surrounds any professional athlete or a happy individual involved in many sport activities regardless.OMEGA 3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA and it is the same for any brand of flax seed regardless if such flax seed oil is in solid oil form in a bottle or a capsule form. Greens, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3 since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseeds are important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is the king of nutrients when it comes to minerals so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, highest magnesium, highest potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional.FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16&#8201;lb with 3.7"" (9.5&#8201;cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1""(2.5&#8201;cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia. Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts, a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat, chicken, pork or dairy.Accordingly for 28gr/1oz servings size of;Amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachioTOTAL CALORIES28.6__33.6__ 150__166__161__137__160__162__155__156CALORIES FROM CARBS21.2__23.6__33__28.9__24.6__50__26.8__31.2__34.4__31.8CALORIES FROM FAT3.7__4.8__98.8__121__116__72.1__116__112__103__104CALORIES FROM PROTEIN3.7__4.9__17.8__16.8__20.6__15.2__17.2__19.1__17.7__20For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia's ""CARB CALORIES"" gain but 50% more ""FAT CALORIES"" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss. Sesame, flax and hemp are my superfood but almonds are the superfood when it comes to vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon, priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients except B-complex. No wonder Burma is the highest producer of sesame in the world. But none of those kings offer ALA and not only flax's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so worthless and abandoned in all foods that not healthy at all.

Whether this is normal or not for this roast, I don't know.All the other italian, and dark/full-bodied roasts I've had have been much darker, bordering on blackish, and have at least some oil on the bean surface.This coffee brews extremely light as an espresso.  I'd say it's nutty and a bit sweet as well. Lacks depth & complexity.  It is smooth, but so is water.

If you have had better luck with specific blends, bless you, but I think it's not my crappy Karma, but their crummy coffee.  Just my two cents; your mileage may vary.

They do make a very nice cup of regular coffee if ground using the 'course' setting of my bur grinder. I've decided to just use them for coffee as they make a pleasing cup of moderately strong coffee if you use enough beans. I use approximately twice as many beans as I do with the 100% Kona that is my usual bean to get coffee that tastes substantial. These beans also cost half as much as the Kono beans do, so I guess that's tolerable.I would not recommend these for Espresso. For normal coffee they're fine, but still not in any way remarkable.",3.0
2082,The Best Sea Salt,"This is the only sea salt I'll use now. This has the right texture, size, and taste for all my cooking needs. Just a small amount sprinkled on food gives an abundance of flavor. The package is comes in is an added bonus. Try it--you'll love it!",5.0
2086,Just so so...,I read a review and was excited to try this salt. I didn't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion. It is available at any grocery store and much cheaper too!,2.0

2100,very little jasmine flavor,"As the title states - I'm looking for JASMINE tea.  this is more like green tea, no hint of jasmine.  Not ordering this again",2.0
2103,Extremely small,"I figured the box would at least be the size of my hand...not quite. It's very small, and the chocolates inside even smaller. One reviewer called them &#34;bite-sized&#34;...this is maybe 1/4 the size of a bite I would take, and I have a pretty small mouth. So I wouldn't call these bite-sized. Each piece is maybe half the size of a penny.As for the taste...well, they taste pretty good. The strawberry is painfully artificial, but it could be worse. There's something the Japanese do to the artificial strawberry flavoring that makes it addictive. The little chocolates will melt in your mouth for sure.Also don't order this in the summer like me. Of course they were all melted and the box was oily with melted chocolate. It's not going to come with cold packs because it ships from Japan.",3.0
2105,Delicious little chocolates,"I got these out of curiosity- I like Meiji brand chocolates but had only really had the mushroom-  and bamboo-shaped ones. The box is pretty small (and rather banged up, but it didn't affect the contents.) Its quite difficult not to eat the whole thing in one sitting. The chocolate has a sweet dark chocolate flavor, but not overly sweet. The strawberry flavor is more of a hint, but strong enough to still know its there. Overall it was a nice balanced flavor. I would get them again! I wish they were easier to come by locally.",4.0
2106,Put  Wicks in Them,"I recently ordered some of Meiji's limited-edition chocolate bars online and it occurred to me that perhaps Amazon carried them for less (they don't, at all). My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie. I have no doubt that this review will earn me slams from fan boys (in addition to those guaranteed to turn up immediately, courtesy of obsessive liver-lipped Finnish ugly-boy troll stalkers), but I have to call 'em as I see 'em. 3.5 stars would be about right, but we can't assign by halves so 3 it is.",3.0
2110,Taste Failure At A High Cost,These are very small and a light tannish color. They are not at all like the ones I used to grow in my back yard. I tasted a spoonful of these seeds and had to spit them back out. They were the epitome of staleness. I expected tasty seeds based on the super high price but these are a loser.  I guess I will have to go back to growing my own.I put this bag of seeds into my bird feeders and during this unusually cold freeze and lots of snow there are more birds hanging around the feeders then I have seen in years. They are not as picky as I am and they gobbled up the seeds in a NY minute. I give the seeds an extra star because the birds ate them all up. These seeds are clearly not worth the price and especially not for bird food. I buy 35 pound bags of black sunflower seed at BJ's for around 30 bucks and the birds love them. Don't buy these stale Now Foods seeds.,2.0

2132,Decent Offering if you Walk On the Lighter Side,"Having tried the three top brands on Amazon for ""coffee candy"" (these, United, and Bali's Best), I found Kopiko the least satisfying of the three, which isn't to say they weren't enjoyable. The one snag I kept hitting with these is every time I popped one in my mouth I got an unsatisfactory smack of a taste that just didn't resonate with candy at ALL. Having looked at the ingredients, I think it's the vegetable oil. Once I get passed that initial bewilderment of trying to decide exactly what it is I'm eating, a subdued coffee and cream flavor comes through. That's all good and well, except if what I want is coffee candy, then I expect coffee candy! Don't give me a latte or cappuccino when all I asked for was coffee.",3.0

2137,Poor Delivery Method~,"Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....",3.0
2139,A good buy...,"...money wise, in any case. They're much cheaper than in any stores in our area. The only drawback is cleaning them off and breaking off the stems. It might take a while. Otherwise, no complaints. They're delicious after soaking them for about 20 minutes in cold water. I love them in gravies and over potatoes and pasta.",4.0
2144,Why buy boxed stock?,"These are wonderful Porcini.  Usually, I do not require uniformity of size in the applications to which I put them so no sense paying more for uniform size. The porcini I had been using I learned were imported from China.  These are imported from Italy.  Admittedly, since all my genes came from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century, I may be biased.  After rinsing these mushroom, I use the soaking water as stock in whatever I am making.  The flavor is wonderful and it is easy. I store them in glass canning jars in my pantry and they seem to be holding up nicely.  It I got in a fussier mood, I'd pop the jars in the freezer.",5.0
2145,Fast Shipment & Lots of Mushrooms,"Every time I make some store bought spaghetti my husband is looking for mushrooms to spice up that plain sauce.  I hated opening up a can because we would not eat that many.  My mom use to have dried mushrooms and would use them in soups or whatever so I thought I'd give these a try.  First, they came very quickly.  Second, I didn't realize what a huge bag this actually is.  Even with the bag closed, they smell so, so good.  I have not used them yet, just got them today but cannot wait to try them out.  Their website shows you can store these for a year in a cool place like the refrigerator so I know they'll keep for awhile.  Thanks for the quick shipment.  I hope to be trying these in other dishes also.  Three stars only because I wasn't happy with this seller's customer service department on not acknowledging an email on a different order.",3.0

2158,How pepper should be,"The blend is beautiful, flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground. The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident. I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag.  The packaging needs to be rethought, though.  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isn't really user friendly.  Something self sealing would be preferable.  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag, the cellophane doesn't want to stop tearing when you do.  Scissors are the best way to open and you'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder.  I'll certainly be purchasing these again.",4.0

2203,A chili sauce worth crowing about,"Sriracha's a great early morning pick-me-up on the ol omlet.  It's also great on pizza, stirfry, soups, panini sandwiches (spritz a little atop the cheese the next time you make one, and see for yourself), etc.  Great for livening up roasted red pepper hummus, tomato sauces, mayonnaise, you name it.  The uses are innumerable.I'm a self-avowed chili-head, and I've tried more chili sauces than I can easily count.  Everyone has their favorite styles and brands, and I'm no different, because this happens to be one of mine.The thing I like about Sriracha is how the flavor and texture of freshly ground sun-ripened red chilies shine through cleanly ... there are no gritty/bitter seeds, no oxidized flavors from using reconstituted dried chilies, no caramelized/overcooked flavors, no competing heavy mismatched flavors/spices, no mouth pucking wretched excesses from being pickled in cider vinegar and salt, no fatiguing smoke flavors, no fruit juices, no excessive heat, no thermonuclear oil essence extracts, etc.  Most of those things have their time, place and uses, and good examples of each abound ... but not here.No.  Sriracha is just plain, beautiful, de-seeded, unobstructed, sun-ripened fresh red chili flesh, with just barely enough garlic, salt, vinegar and sugar to round it out, plus a little gaur gum to thicken it slightly, and a little sorbate for extend it's freshness.  That's it.  It's pleasantly piquant, but not overly so.Highly recommended.p.s. A convenient fallback for me, whenever Sriracha is unavailable, is Franks RedHot Original.",5.0

2243,An okay hot sauce,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite.  Even though it is not terrible--I used two bottles of it--it is not something that I would use on a regular basis.  As for the sauce's flavor, it is distinctive yet peculiar.  It has a nice heat to it, also--not too mild and not too hot.  I have used it on multiple kinds of food.  I do not consider Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to be a preference, but I do admit that it stands out from the other hot sauces that I have used.  Actually, I rate it 2.5 stars.",2.0

The ALCOHOL smell and flavor killed everything, I threw away that bottle. Going to open another and write yet another update as needed.  I'm probably going to go back to making my own Vanilla flavoring which will take awhile to get a new batch but worth it.Previous Review:I feel that this is a little diluted in flavor and I have to use 2x the amount if not 3x the amount to achieve a nice subtle, but noticeable flavor in my baking (using it in pancakes takes a great deal to flavor it to my taste). I love putting vanilla in my oatmeal that I boil with cinnamon but I just feel like I can never get that great smooth vanilla flavor.  I do use a high grade cinnamon so it may overpower the vanilla in all fairness.  So all in all I think the product is okay to good, but I am trying to find a vanilla extract from the same company I buy my almond extract from, which I also buy from Amazon.  I'm doing more cooking this weekend so I'll update my review in needed once I open my new bottle of this.",3.0

2294,Stick to the Japanese brands unless you are cheap,"In light of the glowing reviews and excellent dollar-per-ounce price ratio, I bought these. It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi brand but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi brand, and most other Japanese brands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi brand just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag. I had no idea how large a bag 5 lbs of peas would be, but it turns out it's about 3 macbook pros stacked on top of each other. That bag is HUGE!Anyway, this..mundane tasting wasabi pea may be healthier and more organic, I don't know. But it most certainly won't turn any nonbeliever into fans.

We say NO!,"Kellogg's Frosted Flakes contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. That's right, folks! GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. Foreign genes have been forced into the DNA which cause every cell of the plant to make its own pesticide. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. When people bite into it... well who knows! Two recent studies linked the pesticide toxins in the corn to human cell membrane death and the death of neonatal kidney cells. A study done in Canada found the Bt toxins in the blood serum of 93% of pregnant women tested, and 80% of their unborn babies. The FDA lets the chemical companies decide if they're safe - there is no requirement for long term, independent, peer reviewed studies to test it before it gets into your food. There are 50 countries around the world that require products to be labeled when they contain genetically modified ingredients... all of Europe, China (!), Japan, Russia (!), Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, India and more. In the US, there is no labeling law. We hit the jackpot! We have Michael Taylor appointed as our food safety czar and guess where he came from! MONSANTO... the number one chemical company creating and selling GMOs. To make it worse, they have also inserted foreign genes into the DNA of sugar, soy, canola and cottonseed. (POP TARTS contain ALL of these - don't buy them!) They've made ALL of these GMOs resistant to high doses of an herbicide called RoundUp. (Guess who also sells the RoundUp - you got it! Monsanto!) The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp is called Glyphosate. If you google it, you'll find that it's linked to birth defects, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and more. No wonder everyone seems to be getting sick! Kellogg's doesn't want you to know any of this and they have recently contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California, where voters will be voting on Prop. 37 for the labeling of genetically engineered foods on November 6th. They are trying to trick people into voting against labeling by telling them its going to raise their grocery bills by $400 a year and other things which are totally untrue.

For a while I had a rebellion against this soda because of them making changes in their taste to match other companies. I guess thats a marketing technique or something, because the goal is to sell more products, and have a higher turnover rate. And for about 3 years, I wouldn't drink this soda. Just about the start of this year I decided to give Coca Cola Classic another try, and thinking they are going back to the older formula (trust me, you can notice the difference). Coca Cola is on the rise once again, and I hope that it will be back on top with their products in the soda industry. For right now I have a good wait ahead of me because of my high expectations from them.Don't get me wrong, I've always liked their products, especially Cherry Coke and Sprite, as well as the original Coca Cola Classic. I just believe that it shouldn't try TOO hard in competion, because that can seriously backfire.Chandler Infamous, and I'm ghost. Peace!",3.0
2378,SodaStream is the real thing now not Coke,SodaStream cola is much less weight making it more cost effective to ship. SodaStream cola tastes so great so why would you want to drink this anymore. Plus u can put the SodaStream cola flavor on ice cream & use it to sweeten your cereal instead of milk. Soda Stream has just made a better cola than Coke. Too bad for Coke. Sodastream makes machines that use the 60L carbonating bottle & the 130L carbonating bottle.  I use the fountain Jet that can use the 130L carbonating tank. I like the larger carbonating tank & get a spare. You can switch the 60L bottle out for a larger one when you exchange it. Also you will wan 2 use cold refrigerated water 2 carbonate with. some extra  carbonating bottles that you put water in & keep in the fridge. Also get the MyWater flavors which are excellent with seltzer water which you now will be able to make. Try using less syrup to make the sodas than advised & you may prefer that. The MyWater flavors I just use a tiny drop per liter way less than the half a teaspoon recommended. Also the Sodastream ice sticks are great & can be used to cool water down for carbonating.,1.0
2387,A Skin Problem Remedy This is NOT.,"Being a shy, backward person, it is truly difficult to tell my story, the story of a person suffering from near-necrotic epidermis. But I'll give it my best and relate to you the shortcomings, nay, the failings of this product as a skin treatment.As difficult as it is to admit, I suffer from chronic, persistent Folliculitis. This horribly tragic skin affliction has been my curse since puberty and only grows worse by the year. It starts with small bumps, but with uncontrollable scratching and flaking, it has transformed my somewhat-normal skin into a leather-like covering that only serves to keep my veins, arteries and organs intact. At first it attacked only my arms and stomach and was easily hidden by longish-sleeved t-shirts. Winter was a godsend, as I could slink around fully clothed and the casual observer would never know my affliction. Keeping a calm demeanor and having passably handsome face, I would sometimes merit even the occasional approving nod or glance.All that has changed with time, however. Summer or winter, I must drag myself along like a strict Mormon in long sleeves and pants, envying all other humans as they laugh and play in short sleeves, tank tops or even go shirtless.Then I met Dr. Smetigonavitadong, my ayurvedic dermatologist. He assured me all would be cured if I'd only bathe myself daily in whole milk, preferably Tuscan. Living outside the fringes of society, whole milk would be hard to find (even moreso, whole milk of the Tuscan variety), but thanks to the internet and Amazon, I was able to procure said product in the form of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fluid ounces. I purchased several cases.Months have gone by and, disappointingly, I've seen no change. Pustules and pimples remain, fetid and squamous as ever. And worse yet, I've found that the good Doctor is an investor in the entire Tuscan Whole Milk financial scheme! My embarrassment is complete, as I've been taken by an ayurvedic quack! Adding insult to injury, I have an entire cache of spoiling whole milk and I'm lactose intolerant!Now nights are spent reading Wikipedia to learn various cheese recipes. Any help would be appreciated from those residing in Wisconsin or of Swiss lineage.",2.0
2388,Does God Still Speak to People?,"A young man had been to Wednesday night Bible Study. The Pastor had shared about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man couldn't help but wonder, ""Does God still speak to people?"" After service he went out with some friends for coffee and pie and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked about how God had led them in different ways. It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest thought to stop and buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz. He shook his head and said out loud, ""God is that you?"" He didn't get a reply and started on toward home. But again, the thought, buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz. The young man thought about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could always use the Tuscan Whole Milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk and started off toward home. As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn Down that street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection. Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will"".He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in semi commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the Tuscan Whole Milk to the people in the house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat. ""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and if I wake them up, they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" Again, he felt like he should go and give the Tuscan Whole Milk. Finally, he opened the door, ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will give them the Tuscan Whole Milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something but if they don't answer right away, I am out of here."" He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?"" Then the door opened before the young man could get away.The man was standing there in his jeans and T-shirt. He looked like he just got out of bed. He had a strange look on his face and he didn't seem too happy to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young man thrust out the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, ""Here, I brought this to you."" The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the Tuscan Whole Milk toward the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was crying. The man had tears streaming down his face.The man began speaking and half crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any Tuscan Whole Milk for our baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some Tuscan Whole Milk.""His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with some. Are you an Angel?"" The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he had on him after paying $2,500 for the milk  and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward his car and the tears were streaming down his face. He knew that God still still speaks to people to buy Tuscan Whole Milk.",5.0

2404,A Conspiracy of Bovine Proportions,"It's all well and good to indulge our creative writing and have a little fun at Amazon's expense, but what do we really know about this so-called Tuscan Milk? I will endeavor to prove that it is neither Tuscan nor milk.Everyone knows nascut (an anagram and almost a backwards spelling exactly of t-u-s-c-a-n) is Romanian for ""born"" (specifically, the past participle of naste). So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern, rather than Southern, Europe, and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean. Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles, and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour, is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote, ""A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step""?As for the question of color over origin, we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation. To be sure, the pictures of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz appear as white as newly fallen arctic snow. But color theory teaches us that white is after all the combined color spectrum.

Being an African American female with type 4a/4b textured hair, I have been on a years long journey to find something that would moisturize my tightly bound coils throughout the day. When my Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz arrived by mail I was ecstatic.The packaging was flawless, I noted that nothing had spilled en route. However, I was concerned that the jug-like design would make it difficult to apply this runny product to my locks. I did mitigate this by mixing the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz with some shea butter and left over Kinky Curly Knot Today detangler.As expected, the mixture went into my roots a little white, so I sat under the dryer to allow it to set into my curls. The initial results were shiny, perfectly clumped ringlets! Because I am a zoo keeper, I have to report rather early to work to feed various animals before they are handled in various demonstrations throughout the day. This particular weekend, I was on meerkat duty. By sunrise, the weather had begun to cool, and I noticed a little of the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz dripping down the back of my neck. I took it a harmless and carried on, because I may have over applied the mixture, and made a note to use less in the future.Everything continued innocently enough, however within moments of entering the cage I was overrun by dozens of the small mammals!

2418,PART I --HOW__MUCH__4__POSTAGE__&__HANDLING_?....PART II___THE__DREAM..,"PART I.This is DEFINITELY great-tasting milk, and I'm REALLY glad to see aproduct that probably needs refrigeration on Amazon....because maybe my other favourite products which need refrigeration, (mayonnaise, ice-cream, whole cream, half-and-half), will also soon appear on Amazon.The PRICE, of course, is what makes me wary of ordering it from Amazon. Sigh.........I guess, due to the refrigeration and QUICK shipment made necessary by the extremely perishable nature of this liquid, whole milk, make the high price a necessity.  I believe it originates in New Jersey, or another eastern state.  For those in the central or western areas of the country, (or heaven forbid, Canada or Europe!), this milk's shipping and handling charges will be totally prohibitive.......unless one wins the lottery, becomes a successful actress, actor, writer, musician, investor, model, CEO, etc. --  or marries a rich person who loves Tuscan Whole Milk as much as you do!So, for right now, at least, this delicious milk is out of my price-range, (double sigh!)  Luckily, my local supermarket DOES carry the next-best tasting milk: ORGANIC VALLEY.  It is expensive milk too, and I usually don't get it -- but it's quite delicious, and, whilst imbibing it, I can easily pretend it is the ""creme de la creme"" of milks: TUSCAN WHOLE MILK!PART II.....THE__DREAMPreface:  As many reviews here seem to be part of an amorphous ""Tuscan Whole Milk Creative Writing Contest"", I've decided to try my hand at it as well........I had won the lottery!  This was a very strange feeling for me -- because generally, I don't believe in even entering the lottery!  Though I DO enter the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes every chance I get, I've always felt that state lotteries, and especially mega-million lotteries, encompassing serveral states, were totally impossible for me to win.  So, I never bought a ticket for any lottery.  This did not, however, stop my best friend from buying a ticket for me for my birthday.  One ticket.  And it won!  It won me $738 million dollars....and twenty-three cents!I had always thought that if I came into a lot of money, the first thing I would do is ask Warren Buffet if I could consult with him on the best way to invest it.  However, the first thing I REALLY did, was go to my computer, go to Amazon.com, and order thirty-five gallons of Tuscan Whole Milk, (I like to put in a big supply of things, because prices keep going up), plus a mew refrigerator and freezer to put them in, as my current 15-cubic foot refrigerator-freezer seemed woefully inadequate to store all that milk.  All of these things arrived within the next two weeks -- two weeks which had been busy with TV interviews, meetings with lawyers, and the discovery of about 3,000 new relatives of whom I had never heard before.....It just so happened that, just after my new refrigerator and freezer, and thirty-five gallons of delicious TUSCAN Whole Milk had arrived, I happened to turn on the TV, and discovered that Mr. Warren Buffet was making a visit to the town where I live!  I put in a call to his hotel room and was lucky enough to actually talk to Mr. Buffet himself! (The MSN article had unwittingly divulged the name of the hotel at which hotel Mr. Buffet was staying, in the initial appearance of the article...though the information disappeared within fifteen minutes on the screen, when a hasty re-write of the article, minus hotel revelation, appeared).  Mr. Buffet was kind, and thoughtful, and immediately put me totally at ease.  He even offered to come to MY home, instead of my travelling to his hotel!With my new personal assistant, I hastily set up the dining room table, with food that I HOPED Mr. Buffet would like: smoked salmon, hamburgers and rolls, lemon sole, (he could take his pick!), and 7-layer cake, served with coffee and, (proudly), with my new Tuscan Whole milk.....When Mr. Buffet arrived, I felt I had re-met an old friend.  He was so unassuming and natural!  Happily, I led him to the dining room table, hoping that the food would put us even more at ease.  I looked forward, not only to ""drinking in"" his advice, but also to the beautiful platters arranged on the table.However, when Mr. Buffet saw what was on the table, he audibly gasped.  I was afraid he was having a heart-attack, and came immediately to his aid.""That....that MILK!"" he gasped.  ""You threw away money on THAT milk!  It's $129 a gallon!  How...how could you?  How could ANYONE?""With that, he stormed out of my house.I've had a lot of fun and adventures, with my lottery winnings.

2455,Well know but FAR from the best.  Rated LAST in a recent taste testing of Hot Sauces by a professional tasting panel,"I've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to ""kick up"" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.After taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar but a hint of sugar and garlic. Top rated by many.2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers3) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce (milder and with less vinegar)4) Huichol Hot Sauce (milder - less vinegar - not so widely available)5) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar)I hope I've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this onePS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a ""plus"" in my view but rather a ""minus"" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.UPDATE ----- A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out: While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.What sauce came in FIRST? ------ Huy Fong Sriracha.What sauce came in very LAST? ---- TabascoI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.Tastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce.",2.0
2459,"After branching out and trying other brands, it's clear that Tabasco is overrated and low-quality.  Not a good sauce.","I used to be a Tabasco fan.  I really did.But after branching out and trying other sauces, I can't help but see how flawed it is.  And I think its popularity is due not to its quality, but due to it being a recognizable brand.The quality shockingly isn't as high as you might think.  In fact, I find it to be quite low-quality.  After sampling many other sauces in the past few months (I'm going through a hot-sauce kick lately), Tabasco in retrospect comes off as quite cheap-tasting and with no real flavor.  And the burn isn't natural.  It tastes ""chemically.""  Mainly due to the fact that all you taste is vinegar.  And to me, that's not the mark of a good sauce.  A good sauce should have a natural burn (moreso like fire or radiating heat) and a nice flavor to it.  It shouldn't taste too vinegary and it definitely shouldn't have an artificial-feeling ""chemically"" burn.  But that's what Tabasco really tastes like when I really pay attention and analyze it.Just to make my analysis more fair and up-to-date, tonight I decided to do a taste-test with it and some of the others sauces I had on hand.  I used about six different sauces in comparable amounts.  Straight to the tongue.  (With a ""cool down"" period in between so I could clear my mouth out of the burn and flavor)  And classic Tabasco was the worst in terms of flavor.  I hate to say that, because I know its popular due to its recognizable nature.  But it was the worst by far.  To the point I almost just tossed the whole bottle in the trash, because I don't see myself using it ever.  I didn't, since I figured I should have it on-hand for friends who may want some.  But I definitely won't be using it again.I'm quite saddened by how poorly classic Tabasco holds up.  But don't get me wrong.  I do like some of their other available flavors a little bit.  (I think their Chipotle sauce is ok, because it at least has a slight touch of flavor, though again, it's far too ""vinegary"" for its own good.)  But classic Tabasco is just very poor in retrospect.Low quality.  No real flavor.  Gross ""chemically"" burn.  I'd say branch out and try something new instead of going with the same-old Tabasco.",1.0

I think it's the savory that makes everything I put it on taste so good. One tip is a must when using any dried herb: be sure to rub it roughly between your palms to break out the freshness. It will now be a staple in my spice library.",5.0

2510,Spicy but not chocolatey enough,This cocoa chile blend was nice and spicy but the overall flavor was a bit disappointing. I expected more creamy chocolate goodness. It's best for sprinkling on top of regular hot cocoa or as an ingredient in baking rather than to drink it by itself.,3.0
2514,WARNING: These Reviews MAY NOT BE FOR SAFFRON!!!,"Update:  It appears that this may be at least partially fixed.  In my case, it seemed to sort reviews so the relevant ones appear first.  However, the nearly five star rating is still not broken down by product, so you cannot tell if any specific product is getting lower ratings without reading every review.  The products have to be treated completely separately, and they are still not, so the nearly five star rating is useless other than to say that McCormick overall has great products.--------------------------------------------The way these seasonings are mixed into one, you would think whatever seasoning you purchase to be excellent, but unfortunately, because there are so many, there is no way to know.I thought coming to the review I was reading reviews on Saffron and realized the people were reviewing completely different products like lemon grass.These reviews are for McCormick seasoning in general, not the specific product, so if you are here reading this review because you thought you were reviewing a specific product, you are mistaken as I was.Not all products across the product line are the same quality and have widely varying costs, so reviewing them all as though they represented a single product is misleading at best.",1.0
2515,Spice Up My Life!,"I live in a family with 2 very small children and so the ultra spicy foods that I like are not on the menu here.

2524,The Original Can Version Was Better,"It has been a while since McCormick shifted from the tin to the glass bottle.  I have found some archival pictures of the tim version, but have been unable to locate the ingredients list order on those sites.  The flavors are different, in my opinion, causing my recipes to be less flavorful.  Now, I add more Mediterranean seasonings to aid in boosting the punch, with little effect.  I have not chosen to add more heat via red pepper, as the heat level does dictate the punch.  Perhaps, MSG would help.If you compare web images for each mixture, the appear different... more red pepper flakes and larger flakes of oregano in the original blend image...but one snapshot is not necessarily indicative of the average blend for either new or old products.  The new blend is more subdued, and I miss the power in the tin.  McCormick's website has limited remarks, identifying the packaging shift from the can to glass bottles, without clarifying no change in ingredients occurred since the original formulation.",3.0

2637,Makes coffee taste very good.,"I like my coffee creamy not to the point where it turns white but just enough to lighten the darkness so that the dark liquid starts to look like caramel in color. Coffee mate is perfect because it does the job very effectively and it has a nice taste as well.  This is a good option for the lactose intolerant.The subscribe and save option brings the price down to 5.35, which I think is probably the cheapest for a container this size.There are certain things that I feel should be considered for people drinking this stuff.....One teaspoon has about 10 calories so if you are like me who puts a table spoon that is 30 calories. I mentioned this because I drink 3 cups of coffee every day- the calories can add up pretty fast.Coffee mate also contains trans fats - one of the ingredients is Mono- and diglycerides - these are agents used to extend the shelf life and we also see them in foods which have trans fats, which have been bad. It also contains hydrogenated fats which is linked to heart disease. Incidentally the European version is sold without this ingredient.Enjoy responsibly.Source: http://www.organicauthority.com/health/what-the-heck-is-coffee-mate-creamer.htmlhttp://www.cspinet.org/",5.0

Regardless of the reasoning behind sugar avoidance, this actually has corn syrup, which is sugar!

It probably deserves half a star more but the doctor is still out so for now 4 Stars, which is above average, stands in solid grounds. One thing I have found out that depending on the coffee I use (I use ground coffee in an old gevalia, cheap monkey that I am) the ratio changes. But once the right amounts are used this product elevates itself.

2749,Nutrition Facts Varies...,"Prices vary considerably on this brand, check before purchase.This is  NOT organic, it is conventional so a huge difference in the nutritional values organic vs. none organic. These are NOT grade A molasses either. One tbsp of organic molasses offers me 20% iron, 10% calcium which is more than milk's calcium since milk's calcium is fortified, molasses calcium is not, 20% potassium, 8% magnesium, and 10% copper. With 40~60 calories and 10~13gr sugar, I only use one tbsp a day in my green tea daily as well as when I am in need of fast energy, without any additives. Potassium stops cramps and this is a life saver. Once opened, I place some in a smaller tightly sealed container and keep it in refrigerator, refill as needed, but consume it in less than 6 months. I am into sports, diet and nutrition and blackstrap molasses' nutritional value varies depending on the quality of the sugar cane or beets from which it was extracted. For that reason organic and brand is extremely important to me. Honey loses its medicinal value when added to tea but since molasses is a by-product which is heated during the production so further heat does not impact the nutritional value. With all that said, you will still need to get used to the taste since the taste is somewhere around bitter, beet juice and changes the taste of the tea. Bravo.",3.0
2751,A Very Good Product,"special note:  This is a review of the product, not the offered price.I don't use a lot of molasses in my cooking but when I bake ginger snaps I love that the recipe I have calls for 1/4cup of molasses.  Why?  Because molasses have a lot of iron.  4% of the daily requirement per 1 tablespoon of Grandma's.  Not a fantastic amount per cookie, but every little bit helps with toddlers and growing big kids.That said, you can imagine my surprise when my husband brought home another brand -Golding Farms- where the iron percentage is double (2X!) Grandma's.Something to consider.Pam Teemom/foodieps--this is the 2nd best molasses advice I ever got --first is don't use sulpured:  Use a spray oil on measuring cups.

2872,Good for absinthe,"Sugar cubes are perhaps hard to mess up, but Domino does manage to get its box chock-full of them, all stacked in neat rows so that no space is wasted.  Indeed I actually had to do a little maneuvering to actually get the first cube out!  The cubes are small enough that you could pile for or five on a teaspoon, which makes it easy to decide just how much you want.  Quite satisfied with this.",5.0
2873,I used to love it,I used to love it because it tasted great and it was reasonably priced. Now the price is astronomical and the taste is not as chokolaty and too sweet.I do not understand why it is so expensive now and why it is so sugary.,2.0
2882,You Gotta Love It!,"Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of ""buck$"" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with ""chocolat chaud"" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout!Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a ""bowl of soul,"" a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others. It may move you, as it does me, to rhapsodic heights. Twenty servings per can, give some to your sweetie.",5.0

2908,"Review of the ""new"" cupcakes","I, like so many others, picked up a box of the ""new"" cupcakes as soon as they hit the shelves of our grocery store. I had much of the same curiosity as others did, wondering if these improved on the previous recipe or not.No, no it doesn't. These are ultimately the exact same cupcakes that you could buy months ago. The only difference is that the box is branded with new slogans about Hostess's come back.These aren't bad, but they're just sort of middle of the road cupcake quality. They're nice and moist, as they were obviously made recently, but these just aren't really that exciting. The cupcake and icing are the best part of this, but the cream filling is where this falls short. It's just a little dab (not that any of you were expecting as much as there used to be) and it's so overly processed that I almost at times feel that the cupcake could have been a little better without it. If you've ever had one of these cupcakes or any of Hostess's cream filled products from about 10+ years ago, you'll know that the filling used to be much better- creamier and richer. These? Eh.If you've loved the previous formula of cupcakes from a year or so ago, you're in luck. These are pretty much the same recipe. I was just hoping that perhaps the company would take the time to tweak these a little to where they're more than just your standard run of the mill snack cake. I'll probably buy these again in the future, but I won't run out to get them.",3.0

2914,Hostess is back on-line,"Hostess got a lot of free publicity when it declared bankruptcy and voided its obligations to pay its retired employees pensions' and healthcare obligations.  Of course the 'assets' - the factory and recipes - were quickly sold to venture capital; and employees who didn't care to be out of work along with their suddenly-evaporated non-pensions were rehired, so pretty much business as usual in the USA.This free publicity reminded me of Hostess Cup Cakes, my favorite in the 80's.  They used to come in packs of 2, so when I saw that this was a box of 8, I thought it was a box of 8 packs of two.  Nope, it's a box of 8 single cupcakes, each one individually wrapped.They're also about half the size they were in the 80s - if that - and they are not packaged in plastic cups any more, just sitting on a cardstock board, so they are sort of squashy and get molded roughly into a cube shape on their journey to your house.They tasted just like I remember 'em; moist cake, rich chocolate flavor, creamy icing, and of course that white foam, reminiscent of Chantilly cream, in the middle.  They arrived a few days before their sell-by date and freshness was not in question; they tasted fine.I am not sure I am really on board with a buck fifty apiece for such tiny morsels - I can get larger, fresher, less technologically engineered cupcakes at that price at the local bakery - but otherwise, these cakes deliver as expected.",4.0

Basically the sauce is like hot sauce mixed with worcestershire sauce (another philyodaddy fave) mixed with steak sauce. It is kind of hot and kind of sweet. It is delicious and that is all you need to know.  STRONG Recommendation.The one question mark is that it is produced by the ""Try Me"" Brand. That always weirded me out, I am not sure why. Try a little harder, ""Try me""Also, usually costs like $3 at the super market (assuming you can find this in the gems aisle), so don't you dare pay double that.",5.0

2965,Awesome flavored green tea,"Due to the recent 30% off special for select Lipton tea here on Amazon, I have been stocking up like crazy. The Lipton Green Tea Orange Passionfruit & Jasmine is in my opinion one of the better tasting flavors from Lipton's green tea lineup. The flavor is strong but not overpowering which is good because I don't want to feel like I'm drinking a fruit juice. I am a little disappointed in the actual green tea taste because there really isn't that much to begin with. However, to counter that, I do drink green tea for health benefits and not for its taste! This tea, like most of the Liptons I buy, I always drink cold. I do like to drink a hot cup or so whenever I can after a greasy meal but cold tea is much better in my opinion.Also, this tea is very similar to the pyramid bag shaped Mandarin Orange green tea from Lipton as well.",4.0

HOWEVER, I also have been making my tea the old fashioned way by using a tea ball and steeping it and I still couldn't enjoy the flavor.This was a bland tea with an aroma that is reminiscent to Vicks VapoRub, well at least to my nose. It must have some essence of Eucalyptus and/or camphor in it although the ingredients say not. It is supposed to have been scented with bergamot, but frankly I'm not so sure.A pale gold tea with a pale flavor. It is very, very delicate not the hearty type of tea I prefer.

3032,Filtered Buckwheat...,"For pollen in honey refer to the link provided in the comment section. Buckwheat Honey when raw, has more nutrients since it is unpasteurized and not force filtered, to deliver the highest possible levels of enzymes, vitamins and minerals. Raw honey tastes different than filtered or process honey but more importantly majority of raw honey are in solid form not liquid unless you apply heat or do not store properly. Dutch Gold is not raw, it is filtered and although it tastes like buckwheat since it is from buckwheat flower, an acquired taste, processing takes out the nutrients and that is why it is not in a solid form but liquid form. Dutch Gold is more reputable company than most regardless. Raw Tupelo honey is in liquid form, rare but that is how Tupelo is but Buckwheat in solid form.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for ""ultrapurified,"" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Honey helps kill the bacteria that may cause infection. When honey comes into contact with damaged skin, it triggers the production of antibacterial hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the sugars in honey mean there is little space for water molecules (bacteria need water to survive, so reducing the amount available makes it hard for them to thrive). Dabbing on honey or a sprinkling of sugar can deprive the bacteria of water, which ultimately destroys them. Bravo.",3.0

3046,Bags Arrived Leaking -  Third Shipment Much Better,"UPDATE:  I decided to give this company one more try and placed a third order forthree 10 LB bags of Domino granulated sugar.  This time the bags arrived without any damage. I also noticed that the sugar is now sent in heavy plastic bags instead of the paper bags which are so easily damaged in shipment.This sugar is not inexpensive, however, when you consider that these bags are heavy (especially if you are purchasing more than one) and that shipping is free, they are a pretty good deal. Particularly if you are purchasing several bags at once.So I have moved the rating from one star to three..Earlier...I received my order of  4, ten LB bags of Domino's granulated sugar in two separate shipments.  I have no idea why they could not have been shipped at once.  The first 10 LB bag showed up fine.  However, the second three showed upin external bags, because each of the Domino's bags was leaking. One of the three bags was not even in the second bag it had been placed in because it had been leaking, and half of the sugar leaked out into the main shipping box, and  all over the  other items which had been shipped in this box.This was the second order that I had placed with this company in less than a week, because UPS reported that the original order had been damaged in shipment and had to be returned to the seller.Hopefully, you'll have better luck than I did with them.

I like this sugar more than any other but will not be wasting my money with this seller any more. The cost of this bag is also outrageous compared to being bought and any store. I paid almost $12 a bag and only received one usable bag. Not worth it.

3053,I&#8217;ll admit it; I&#8217;m now a soy sauce snob.,"For such a common product, Kikkoman has managed to appeal to my taste buds, and I think most comparisons become quite obvious when sampled side by side.  Consistency is extremely important when using such a condiment, which by nature, is typically consumed a few drops at a time.  I&#8217;ve used soy sauces where there was a dark colored liquid, but virtually no flavor, and others on the opposite side of the spectrum where it appears the bottle was filled with some sort of atomic sodium.For a mass produced product, Kikkoman still employs one ingredient most corporations avoid; time.  In an age where vinegar is distilled in a matter of hours, and vanilla extract produced in a day or so, Kikkoman still brews this sauce for months.  I&#8217;m sure there are scientific ways to accelerate this process, but the mellowing allowed via the passage of time is still favored for this particular sauce.  Considering the length of manufacturing this appears to be quite a value as well for a half gallon.  Just store it in the dark, as soy sauce doesn&#8217;t like the light and you should have a ready supply for quite some time.The product arrived in an easily handled two quart bottle with a flip top lid that covers a  inch hole.  Obviously (I hope this is obvious) an orifice this size is for filling soy dispensers or use in a commercial kitchen, and not as a dispensing device for your plate of rice.  Yet I have this feeling that more than one person has used a half gallon container for this purpose, flooded their meal with the stuff, then blamed the sauce.  If this is your first experience with bulk soy sauce, then supplement your table with a small dispenser.  Ceramic or porcelain make good choices since they keep the light out, and the insulating qualities of those materials keep the sauce relatively cool, which maintains the flavor profile and shelf life.So after many years of sampling various sauces, I have arrived at this station of being a&#8230; Kikko-man.",5.0

However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to.  I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it.  I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!I ended up giving the rest of it away.  A very expensive taste test!",2.0
3100,YUCK and GROSS-,I agree with the review about the strange taste.  I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one. It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste!  Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor.  I ordered 6 boxes...don't know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes left...maybe donate? :-( I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself.,2.0
3101,"Small popcorn, not so great","I'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands. I tried this one because the best, BKH popcorn has gone out of business. I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels. In addition to that on the average 99% popped. The Black Jewel had like 25% not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn. The popped kernels were very small, hardly nothing to eat. The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again. If anyone knows the BKH brand and can suggest one like it let me know.",1.0
3110,A good hot sauce,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce is hotter than most hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider it to be an overpowering heat.  It is a good, nice-tasting hot sauce to have around, and I recommend it.",3.0
3112,"Far too ""vinegary"", but it has some nice smokey, tangy notes to it once you get past that. Good as an ingredient in some dishes.","The thing with Tabasco sauces is that they are actually remarkably low-quality despite their widespread recognition.  Particularly their classic sauce, which just doesn't hold up flavor-wise once you start to branch out and try other types of hot-sauces.But I will contend that this variation, the Chipotle flavor, is fairly decent.  As with regular Tabasco, the flavor is problematic due to the overwhelming taste of vinegar.  But I do find myself enjoying the smokey, tangy notes of this sauce once you get past that initial &#34;Blech!&#34; of the overbearing vinegar flavor.  I don't think it works necessarily as a topping, but those notes of smoke and tang do make it a good addition in recipes.  I find myself using a few spoon-fulls, along with straight cayenne sauce and Ghost Pepper sauce in chili and other similar dishes to give some good flavor.I'm not too familiar with Chipotle products/sauces/foods, but I definitely am interested after trying this.This is one of the few Tabasco products I would definitely recommend people give a shot.  It's not amazing, but it's decent.",3.0

The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy;  we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings.

3121,"Very grassy taste out of the bottle; better to use for dressing, marinade, or for cooking","Let me start of by saying I really really wanted to like this olive oil. Organic, naturally processed, from California, great price, awesome reviews. I was hoping I'd find a full bodied balanced tasty olive oil to take the place of my expensive olive oils from Spain. Please note, I am a sommelier and have a pretty refined palate. Just like with my wines I look for balance. I don't mind acidity, I don't mind bitterness, I don't mind a bit of fresh herbaceous taste. Balance for me is key. I like my olive oil to be  rich, nutty, and full of balanced flavor. Fruity, buttery, earthy, peppery are all good ...again they need to be in balance.This oil is way too overtop green and grassy tasting. If you like the taste of wheat grass juice then this will be up your alley. I pored an ounce in a dish and just dipped my bread in it. Full bodied, very grassy, good acidity, with a long somewhat bitter finish. Maybe made into a dressing you can hide some of these overpowering unbalanced favors. Who knows these flavors might even signify a healthier olive oil with more antioxidants? I'll pass. I am returning the olive oil and sticking to what I know I like.Update: I hate wasting food and the thought of  returning the Item did not sit right because I knew the item would just be thrown in the trash. So I tried to see if I can use the item for cooking and not straight out of the bottle. Tonight I grabbed four medium tomatoes from my veggie garden, two cloves of garlic, 1.5 ounces of the olive oil, salt and pepper. I heated the oil in a skillet, sliced the tomatoes and added them to the hot oil, added the crushed garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Cooked over the stove top for 3-4 minutes at high heat while occasionally stirring. I then added a few eggs to the mixture , put the lid on the skillet, and let the eggs poach in this thick tomato sauce for 5 minutes. Finally I added an ounce of crumbled feta cheese at the end. Had this for dinner with some Ezekiel bread tonight. Very yummy! The olive oil's over the top grassy flavors were masked by all the other ingredients. So I decided to keep the oil to use in my recipes and not as my go to dipping oil.",3.0

At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same.  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.

In the middle of a bite of fruitcake, there is a rather hard, chewy almond to deal with.  Not pleasant.  And there were a lot of almonds.  The ironic thing is that this fruitcake is made in Georgia and I believe Georgia grows pecans, my favorite.  Next, I found the cake to be rather dry compared to other fruitcakes.  And last of all, I have to agree with my friend who said &#34;it seems to be missing something&#34;.  Maybe the something missing is the alcoholic beverage flavoring most fruitcakes, I don't know.

3167,Not recommended,"I tasted this product at a friend's house. I had to use a lot more of it than I do with pure stevia, and I realized why when I examined the product label and researched information on the product on the NuNaturals website. This product is mostly maltodextrin. This is what is stated in the product information from NuNaturals: ""Add NuStevia to sweeten your favorite food or beverage, 1/4 tsp is as sweet as 1 tsp of sugar. For recipes, 4 tbs [1/4 cup] is as sweet as 1 cup of sugar.""Pure stevia powder is presumed to be 200 times as sweet as sugar. Individual perceptions of sweetness may vary, but I personally find the best brands of pure stevia to be about 40 times as sweet as sugar. Given that the stevia powder used in this product is at best, per the company's own admission, only about 4 times as sweet as sugar, that means that this product is only about one-tenth stevia.For my own consumption, I much prefer to purchase100% pure stevia powder. I'm not a fan of maltodextrin mixed with stevia, and certainly not of natural flavors added to any food I consume which are, for reasons unknown, added to this product. I explain what those ingredients are below.Ingredients: Maltodextrin, stevia extract and natural flavors. Free of soy, MSG, yeast, gluten, wheat, milk, synthetics, artificial colors or flavors, preservatives, saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, or artificial sweeteners.Maltodextrin: This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet. It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler, to improve the texture and appearance in processed food. As a relatively cheap ingredient, it can also add more bulk to a given product, thereby increasing profits for the company using it. In the U.S., most of the time it is derived from rice, corn, or potato starch. Through a process called hydrolysis, the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids. Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further, resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water. Products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin are required by law to say ""wheat"" in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.",2.0

3175,Just Like Porsche--THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE,"I drink a lot of coffee and was using way too much sugar. Being pre-diabetic, I had to find a sugar-free sweetener.  Unfortunately most of them have chemicals in them that have attracted a lot of bad press.  What to do?  On the recommendation of one of my doctors I tried stevia, Nustevia in particular.  Once I learned the proper portion control (it just takes a little to imitate the sweetness of sugar) I was able to avoid the bitterness of trying to use too much.  Nustevia is all we use now.I have tried the store brands of stevia and can say with no reservation that even though they are cheaper, they lack the same potency as Nustevia.  In fact, I'm willing to bet that if you used the amount of store brand that it takes to equal the same taste as Nustevia provides, you would use so much of the store brand that it would actually cost you more.Caution:  Over time the potency tends to decrease. Be careful when opening a new container--it will only take a fraction of the sweetener that the old container required.",5.0

3275,more sodium than regular soy sauce!,"I was recommended this product by a friend who had read several articles on it being a healthier option than soy sauce.  So, I tried it.  It tastes okay - not as good as traditional soy sauce, but a decent substitute in recipes calling for it.  I used it for a few weeks before finally looking more closely at the label.  Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 920mg of sodium per serving.  Low Sodium Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 575mg per serving.  Bragg's has 160mg per serving.  However, all the soy sauces I checked have a serving size of one tablespoon.  Bragg's serving size is HALF A TEASPOON!  This makes it 960mg in an equivalent serving - more than regular soy sauce!  I was shocked, and then angry.Every ""substitute"" product - whether low fat, low sodium, higher fiber, whatever - I have ever tried before now has the same serving size as the product it is recommended in place of.  Not only is this not equivalent, it is a ridiculous serving size. I could not find another liquid condiment of any type (ketchup, mustard, steak sauce, salad dressing, ginger sauce, etc.) that had a serving size smaller than one tablespoon, and many are two tablespoons.  Not only is regular soy sauce lower in sodium, but obviously the low sodium options from name brands like Kikkoman or La Choy are significantly lower.There are many other seasoning options that are lower in sodium than this.  If you like the taste, that is one thing.  However, if you are looking to lower your sodium intake this is not a good product.

3291,Tastes good...but where does all the sodium come from?,"Pro: I like the taste of this product and use it as a stock in soups as well as spray it on popcorn.Con: I believe that their claim of ""no added salt"" is misleading, because:The label on my bottle states: ""160 mg sodium"" in a 2.5 milliliter serving, and that translates to 8 kilograms of raw soy beans per serving (source: [...] impossible. Thus, the sodium MUST be coming from some other source than ""vegetable protein from Soybeans and Purified Water"" (ingredients stated on the label). I would prefer it if they were more forthcoming as to how the product is actually made...it's not just soybeans & water...it is vegetable protein DERIVED from soybeans...question is, how do they derive it??Conclusion: Useful, tasty additive to foods, but best used sparingly as you would any other flavoring...probably no better, or worse, than regular soy sauce chemically made from soybeans (which is probably cheaper, but then you don't know where the soybeans come from).I hope this helps anyone who may be as confused as I was!!",3.0

We used to get powdered eggs from government surplusfoods for the low income when I was a kid up in New Hampshire.

These did not taste anything like I remembered those powdered eggstasting.  They probably don't make them anymore.",2.0

While the bigger can is ideal for you survivalist that are hording year of food that probably never get eaten in your life time, the can can be opened and you can repackage in to smaller mylar zip lock bags...and customize your packaging. I add powdered cheeze and milk along with freeze dried peppers and mushrooms and a pinch of garlic and pepper to my bags when I repackage for hunting and backpacking trips. with that being said, we do have provisions for a month in the event of a disaster. this is a lot of eggs for a month, so I took half of the mix and repackaged in a foodsaver bag. It is sealed up air tight, and once in the container with our other foods, it will not be exposed to light and its shelf life should remain essentially uneffected.I have personally ate the eggs...they mix up rather well. I have MY recipe for embellishing the powdered eggs down to a science. When a 16 year old boy can taste the difference between these and regular scrambled eggs, I must be doing something right.",5.0
3315,I LOVE these!,"Now I feel like I am linked to the military for sure with these wonderful eggs!  I use them to cook with, I make omlets with them and usually I just scramble them.  They are really special to me because when my son came home at Christmas 2012  for the first time in 14 years and I didn't even know if he was still alive I made him cheese egg omelets with these very eggs every morning!  He LOVED them too!  Thank you!",5.0
3316,You should know before purchasing...,"-- That the color of the egg product suffers a bit from being dried.I have uploaded some Product Images to illustrate.The images show 3 bowls:One with Honeyville Farms powder (HV)One with straight dry yolk powder from another vendor (Y) and...One with a fresh large egg (FRESH)The images pretty fairly represent the color issue -- the dry and mixed powders both are duller and browner than the fresh egg.The mixed powders were blended with bottled water as per the label directions, and allowed to stand for several minutes to fully hydrate.A third image shows a batch of scrambled eggs made from the illustrated egg products, with additional seasoning, dairy, spices and garnish. The eggs tasted fine, and looked OK, when lightened with dairy and camouflaged with chives, paprika and butter.What wouldn't?So if you are using the egg powder in dishes where the color is not particularly important, this product should be fine. But if you are depending on the bright cheery yellow of a fresh egg yolk, as in scrambled eggs or an omelet, you should probably stick to fresh.

It's all in what you add and how you season and let's face it, they are dry so nothing will taste like the real thing.

I make amazing banana bread! I threw it out.  I've never used anything but regular flour to bake, so I thought I would try this almond flour since it's suppose to be much healthier w/much less carbs.

I finally worked my way to the end of it and I'm glad to see it gone. Some of the lumps were so huge they filled a quarter cup measure. So, I had to spend a great deal of my scarce baking time mashing lumps out of the almond flour with a fork.

Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.Also, there are some pretty good pods out there, and they are not expensive.

Go with the Senseo-- it's cheaper, better, and a no-brainer.

3615,Terribly Bitter,"The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach.  The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups.  Since then I have tried diluting  each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists.  I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE, EVER AGAIN!I don't blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods.  Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea.  My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores, at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper!",1.0

3622,deceptive label and weak coffee,"I bought this thinking that the coffee was a blend of Sumatran coffee beans. It isn't. It is (it says) at least 50% Sumatran blended with other coffees. They don't mention what other coffees. Could be coffee grown in New Jersey for all one knows. It does have a good flavor but I think the label should clearly state 50% Sumatran Coffee Blend and not put it in small print on the side. I think it is kind of sneaky, but I am sure legal, to label it just Sumatra Blend. One has to wonder what the flavor would be like if it were all Sumatran coffee.update: I wind up using two pods in my Bunn MyCafe machine which says two things. First off, they are the only pods thin enough to place two into my Bunn so there is less coffee in them and secondly, that using only one pod makes for a weak cup of coffee. After I got these, I got Java One Sumatra pods and Wolfgang Puck Sumatra pods. Both are superior and only requires one pod to make a good cup of coffee. I do like the Puck pods the best.",2.0

Plus they were sugar free with all natural and organic xylitol for sweetener.  BUT.....I just purchased a case of them and they were grossly spoiled.  One jar arrived opened and leaking all over the package so I threw it out.  The second and third jars I opened were thick with globs of fungus encrusted blueberry's and smelled awful.  Needless to say, I threw them out......that's thirty dollars wasted.  A fourth jar smelled ok and after tasting a little of it to make sure it wouldn't make me sick, it turned out to be ok....at least I am still hoping so.  I am actually afraid to open the remaining jars.  It's like the company had a few really old jars left and sent them to me to clean out their inventory.  Well, I can tell you that they have lost me as a customer.  I use to buy their cookies for my old uncle but NO MORE.  He is old and might not recognize if they are spoiled, loaded with fungus, or rancid.  I won't be responsible for his demise by buying from an unethical company.

3679,My Favorite Tasty Bite Dish,"In reading the reviews I am surprised that the appearance of this dish is repeatedly mentioned. I didn't notice what some other reviewers view as a disgusting appearance. Perhaps it is because my first experience with this product was a few years ago in a food sampling. Small cup, not a big plateful and I focused on the intense flavors, and the fact that the base is spinach -- something I love and don't consume enough.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I adore this dish. The smell is distinctive -- decidedly earthy --which I relish. The paneer cheese is very light and soft with a texture like silken tofu, but the flavor is of a mild cheese. The cheese serves as a perfect counterpoint to the spicy spinach. Going against tradition I sometimes add a small amount of cooked brown rice, but I prefer the dish undiluted. And, I found the cheese chunks plentiful.The ingredients -- spinach, water, tomatoes, paneer cheese, onions, sunflower oil, salt, garlic, cornstarch, chilies, cumin are startling in their simplicity. Where is the long list of chemicals? Grabbing a convenience meal often means sacrificing both flavor and health -- this gluten free, Kosher dish sacrifices nothing. I will buy this dish as long as Tasty Bite continues to produce it.",5.0
3684,Watery.  Salty.  Too few lentils.,"Perhaps I got a bad batch.  This wasn't at all like the madras lentils enjoyed at Indian restaurants.  It was watery, too salty, and there were not many lentils.  It was like a watery soup, and not like the picture on the package or like a lentil stew.",2.0

3701,Tasty but BUYER BEWARE OF SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE,"I've tried many, though not all, of the Tasty Bite line of ""1 Step - 1 minute"" of products. This Madras Lentils ranks among the best. I think the spices are just right, with on major exception, detailed below, that applies to all their products that I've tried, the consistency is near perfect as the lentils are ""al dente"" (cooked to near perfection) IMHO. As with the entires Tasty Bite line up these are ideal for travel, quick lunches at work or home when you just don't have the time nor desire to spend preparing something. At current prices, they're a terrific value at less than $3 for a ""two serving"" package. Honestly though, unless you're on a near starvation diet, or half a package is being served as a very small side dish to a larger plate of food, I think most people will consume the entire package. I tend to, though I'm cutting back foe health purposes, and the whole package constitutes a full and with one major exception healthy meal; the exception being sodium.. If one is on a weight loss plan that focuses on high protein this is a near ideal product. The nutrition facts for the entire package are as follows:300 calories; 100 from fat . Broken down into detail and percentage IOC the recommended Daily Allowance based upon a 2,000 to 2,500 calories (not a weight loss level for mist people) per day diet, these are marked by the % sign in the details that follow:1. Total Fat 12 grams (18%), 5 grams of which are Saturated Fat (26%), 0 grams of which are Tran Fat2. Cholesterol is 20 mg (6%)3. Sodium: 1,020 mg or 42% of the RDA.  THIS IS EXTREMELY HIGH. Accordingly, if you've got a heart condition or are on a sodium restricted diet, or just don't want all that sodium in one meal then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!4. Total Carbohydrates = 36 grams which = 12%. Of that, Dietary Fiber represents 10 grams (40%); a good thing for most people,while Sugars are a negligible 4 grams.5. You'll get 14 grams of Protein which will help you remain satiated for a good while.6. Finally, the vitamins and minerals content are:Vitamin A - 12%;Vitamin C - 8%;Calcium - 8% and;Iron - a handsome 28%.REMEMBER, THE ABOVE VALUES ARE FOR THE ENTIRE PACKAGE, WHICH IS TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED TWO SERVINGS. I feel this is a better representation to go by because based upon the percentage of reviews that address the portion size at the time of this review, most people I believe consume the entire package at or for one meal.In summary, with the exception of the sodium, this is a relatively healthy product, and one that is well-suited for a lot of weight loss programs. The sodium should not be taken lightly though. It's widely believed that Americans have much to much salt in their diets and if you read the nutritional value of the plethora of products consumed and add to that the amount of table salt people add to their food, you'll understand why I reach this conclusion.Without the sodium though, this us a ""near perfect"" product from a dietary health perspective. It's the sodium content that causes me to give this three stars instead of five. It's too bad that Tasty Bite didn't play around with adding some other herbs and spices that would have allowed them to reduce the sodium and still end up with a palatable and desirable food item.",3.0

Seems you will get these ""overseas"" bars wherever you get them from.2) I wanted the VIOLET CRUMBLE but it is not available in the US anymore.  Some reviewed these and said these bars were close to if not better than the VC.  I disagree greatly.  Although they are both a form of ""sponge"" candy with a chocolate covering, this bar does not come close to the VIOLET CRUBMLE.  The ""sponge"" center only makes me think the word STALE, and the chocolate has something wrong with it.  Not even close to the quality of the chocolate used on the VC.

3770,Excellent Balsamic,"There are countless balsamic vinegars out there, making all kinds of claims about origin, method, aging, and so on, for all different prices.  How to choose?  Well, if you just want to make standard salad dressing, you can buy a decent balsamic vinegar for a third or maybe even quarter of the cost of this one.  But if you want one that you can use by itself in very small quantities, to dip bread in, or drizzle on a lamb chop, or maybe even on vanilla ice cream, and want a sensational taste experience that you just can't get from the products available in the supermarket, this is an excellent choice.  This is an intensely flavorful, sweet balsamic vinegar that in my opinion is as good or better than any available in this price range, regardless of what claims are made about how long it's aged or whatnot.",5.0
3778,Tastes Horrible,"Ok so I gave this 3 stars because I know how healthy gelatin is.

Plus whisking the gelatin into the fruit snack base was not easy and the fruit snacks turned out lumpy. The taste was so bad that I almost threw them away but my husband hates wasting food and ate them while plugging his nose. I'm on the GAPS diet and make lots of meat stocks, which are supposed to end up being pretty gelatinous. Sometimes a stock that I make doesn't turn out as gelatinous is it's supposed to, so I whisk this great lakes gelatin into the broth.

Not to mention the taste and smell of the gelatin itself is absolutely DISGUSTING---It literally tastes like eating smelly, boiled shoes.

3838,Overpriced and overrated,"I purchased these because of the good ratings on Amazon, but was pretty disappointed. First of all, I knew when buying that them these ""truffles"" are not the same kinds of creations that are named truffles by chocolate stores and other chocolate brands. These ""French Truffles"" are actually what I can only describe as soft pieces of chocolate with higher than average cocoa butter content dusted in cocoa.This is not to say that they're bad, which they're not. Plain old chocolate, not the bad-quality kind (like Hersheys), but not the good kind either. I also prefer the types of truffles with a shell and a ganache or other conventional truffle filling inside. And for ~$20, IMO this box of truffles is a bit overpriced and more of a quantity over quality item. This is coming from someone who has tried a LOT of chocolate, some gourmet/small-batch, some mass-produced, and others in the middle (like Godiva). I believe similar, if not identically branded, truffles can also be found in some warehouse stores like Sam's Club, likely at a lower price.In short, I would say that these truffles are probably a bit overrated and at least here on this site, overpriced. They're not that bad, but certainly not worth the price tag. For what you pay after shipping, you might as well go with Godiva or another dependable brand.",3.0
3843,Not sweet in the least,"Maybe I'm different -- I expect candy to be sweet.  These truffles were not sweet at all, weren't light like a chocolate ganache, and were dusted with cocoa that came off  all over me.

They leave a bad taste in my mouth and an unpleasant feeling in my stomache.  I will never again pay any attention to the reviews on Amazon.  How anyone could report that this awfull concoction is good or great is far beyond me.  I may have received a bad lot, but I doubt it.  Obviously, a number of reviewers of this product who rated it four or five stars would rate cow dung as delicious.  Buy a fifty cent candy bar at your local food store instead of purchasing this awful concoction, at least they taste sweet and don't leave you rushing to the frig for something to kill the taste of Chocmod Truffettes.",1.0

3854,Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!,"Buyer Beware Please!  This sweetner is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetner could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetner* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little.  I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ... it's the maltitol!",1.0

It's just like having a slightly carbonated fruit juice rather than darkly-colored sugar water. That's my kind of drink. Excellent.Gary Peterson",5.0
3871,Mild heat combined with too much (?)  vinegar. I've listed a few other hot sauces to consider,"This is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etcWhy 2 stars? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar. If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They cost little more than the smaller sizes.I'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer any of these:a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! No vinegar.b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar.c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend.d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.If you like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of these other hot saucesUPDATE (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen which is a TV program on PBS recently rated hot sauces. Tabasco came in last, Franks came in the middle and top rated was Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili SaucePPS: Bon Appetit magazine recently rated Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce as ""ingredient of the year""",2.0
3876,Just nothing special at all.  Underwhelming sauce that boasts miniscule heat and an underwhelming flavor.,"This was my go-to hot sauce back in my High School days.

And it's probably a good &#34;access sauce&#34; for people who aren't sure about their ability to handle spicy stuff.  But honestly, even as someone with a fairly sensitive tongue, I find the burn completely unnoticeable.  It essentially just tastes like vinegar.  There's nothing to it.I'd recommend looking into other mild sauces.  There are many others with a comparable burn that have a great deal more flavor.  (I'd recommend Tropical Pepper Co.'s Papaya Curry sauce over this any day of the week, for example.  It has a good flavor for its price and basically the same &#34;burn&#34; value as Frank's RedHot.)  Like Tobasco, this is something that is popular because it's a recognizable brand, despite being of a fairly cheap, low quality.",2.0

3878,More like split pea stew,"When I was growing up, split pea soup was a uniform slurry of slow-cooked peas, flavored with a ham bone that would sometimes have small pieces of ham and/or carrots added in to serve. This is a different beast, but it's quite good. The base is that same split pea soup I know, but there's a lot of whole peas (not too mushy, which is nice), potatoes, carrots and chunks of ham. It really eats more like a stew than a pea soup, but it's flavorful and filling.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the meat. It's not bad, but it's not 5-stars, either. A bit tough and not enough fat content to be interesting, it's really just a textural variation in the stew.",4.0

I'll doctor it up sometime by adding a little lemon juice, fat-free sour cream, or mozzarella or parmesan cheese. Add a few crackers, and it's a substantial meal. I am particularly happy that this is available through Amazon Prime, since I live on a bridge-less island and have to haul my groceries over on a ferry.

I just layer low carb tortillas, baked, diced boneless chicken, the soup mixed with a ""sofrito"" kind of mixture consisting of chopped peppers, onion, fresh mushrooms and usually chopped broccoli - saute in a bit of olive oil and add to the soup and on top I put shredded pepper jack cheese or sometimes some store bought already shredded Mexican cheese.At the time of this writing, price Amazon offers for this soup is comparable to Walmart + they'll deliver it right to your door for FREE!The only downside to this soup and the only thing that keeps me from eating it every day is the sodium content. There are 890mg of sodium per serving and 2 servings of soup per can so if you ate the entire can of soup in one sitting that would be a whopping 1780mg of sodium for one meal! I don't have high blood pressure or anything but I do watch my salt intake.If they could figure out a way to reduce the sodium of this soup, it would be perfect and I would eat it probably daily because it tastes so good and is fairly low in carbs.Despite the sodium content, I'm going to keep buying this soup.

The garlic is what I was really hoping for, but it wasn't a very discernible flavor in my bowl. As you can see from the photo on the can and the photo I uploaded, this soup comes with chicken, penne, green beans, corn, tomato, and carrots. The vegetables did come out a little on the mushy side when I had it, microwaved at 3 minutes in a 1000-watt unit (the directions recommend 2-4 minutes), while the penne was just a little firm but in better shape than the veggies. The chicken doesn't look incredibly appetizing (it looks like it's been sitting in some broth in a can, frankly), but it tasted fine and the texture was normal. Overall it was a decent-tasting soup and it did its job of filling me up; you gotta love Progresso and the ridiculous amount of food they can fit into these cans. The broth did leave an unpleasantly-firm ring of color around the bowl as I continued eating.

I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal.  Also, I quite often use ground Italian sausage, instead of hamburger, very tasty!  I look for these meals on sale, because at full price, they are just too expensive for what you get.

To be honest it smelled pretty awful while it was simmering and I wasn't really looking forward to eating it. However, it wasn't too bad. The main thing was that the kids absolutely loved it, with both of them asking for seconds and my son requesting the leftovers for home lunch the next day.I'd buy it again, but probably won't cook it as often as our other favorites.",4.0

Cheesy Enchilada, Cheesy Nacho, Crunchy Taco and Double Cheese Quesadilla are the others. Each package makes five one-cup servings. Our sons like the Old El Paso seasoning;Hamburger Helper LasagnaandHamburger Helper Beef Pastaare too bland for their tastes. This flavor has just the right amount of spice and seasonings to appeal to the under-10-year-old crowd. The box suggests adding a 4.5 oz. can of Old El Paso chopped green chiles five minutes before the end of the simmer time.A prepared serving (one cup) has 270 calories, 570 mg of sodium and 0.5 g of fat; it also provides a good carb load - 22 grams - and 3 g of protein.Adding the cost of the ground hamburger and vegetables as a side dish, we are able to feed two boys for less than $5 and still have enough leftovers to prepare them a weekend lunch.In summary, while this isn't Haute cuisine,Betty Crocker Hamburger Helper Chili Macaroniis an inexpensive option when pressed for time. For price and convenience, I'd give the product a five-star rating. For taste, I give it two stars. Again, though, I'm not the target audience, so I'm settling on a three-star rating.

It's really, really bland.There's nothing inherently wrong with ""bland"" if that's what you are after.  Bland obviously is want one wants for a base for other things, for example.  But the marketing on this product seems deceptive to me.  It is sold as a ""meal in a bowl"" (suggesting it's not just a base, but a fully seasoned dish).  I specifically ordered it because I was looking for a quick way to make some basic cheesy pasta, and the product (and reviews) suggest that this is meant to be a cheese flavored item.  If it was marketed as ""pasta in a mild, light sauce with a hint of cheese flavor"", then I wouldn't have ordered it, because that wasn't what I was looking for.  I can see that someone might be looking for something like that; but in any event, that's not the implication from the packaging.I don't like dissing this product because it sounds like a number of people find it convenient, like the flavor, and want to be able to keep ordering it.

Only on rare occasions - with certain flavors - is Amazon less expensive, as in the case of these butter noodles at $0.84 each through the Subscribe and Save program.The biggest selling point of these pasta or rice side dishes for me remains their great convenience. If you have the main course for a meal ready to go, it's an extremely simple task to prepare one of these well-seasoned sides with about 2 cups of water in a small pot on the stove top in just 6-8 minutes time.Overall, this qualifies as hermit food of superior quality - highly recommended for solitary and not so solitary souls everywhere.",5.0

Now it's not as firm of a mixture and wouldn't go well inside of tortillas.I ended up adding extra beans and shredded chicken, then we just ate it like that. I'll likely do similar things to use up the rest of this box and not order again. I can easily make red beans and rice in my rice cooker.

Unfortunately, a while back, Knorr bought out the Lipton line of rice products and subsequently proceeded to cut costs in any way possible to make more money.  This has unfortunately resulted in the previously quite cheesy rice dish being reduced to a shadow of its former self.  I bought a box of these because I hadn't had them in a while, and because the Chicken and Broccoli variety still holds up well enough only to discover that the new mix results in a very wet cheese sauce (after cooking in the microwave according to the package directions) that is considerably less cheesy than one would expect.  Eventually enough of the sauce will evaporate/soak into the rice & pasta mixture to increase the flavor a bit, but I can't recommend it anymore.  It's become thoroughly average in every respect.",3.0

4197,Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events,"As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.Timeline of Ostrim Food PoisoningEvent..........Date..........TimeOrder from Amazon..........2/11/2011Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

4236,"Good to have on hand for an emergency (ie disaster) or for disaster response, would not eat for everyday - too little nutrition","I first found the Betty Crocker Sweet Mashed Potatoes when on a disaster deployment and needed something I could ""cook"" on a moments notice for lunches at the office or dinner back in my travel trailer (imagine living in a travel trailer in the Great Plains as autumn is setting in and the nearest standing ""restaurant"" is a ""diner"" 10 miles away and the next real place to get a hot meal is a diner over 30 minutes away... and full of tough looking guys from the railroad..There are 2 pouches each containing about 3 'servings' in each box. Quite frankly, one pouch is perfect for a larger individual meal with maybe a sandwich or a piece of fish or a small steak or even as a quick side to a fast food burger (anything is better than french fries sitting in the warmer for too long...)Note it does NOT take 8 Minutes to prepare - I set the water kettle or coffee pot to make hot water, dump the pouch into a bowl, add a pad of butter (preferably real!), toss in a dash of pepper, pour the now ready hot water into the bowl, fluff with a fork and let sit while I'm pouring my drink and gathering up the main item to set on the table (usually next to the laptop, who has time NOT to work - or surf the 'net - in these situations?!)So in a pinch, such as while on a disaster deployment living in a travel trailer or in a hotel room with just a coffee pot (hot water), these packets are GREAT!!!

Also, since the cheese sauce is rich enough, you can cook up some fresh potatoes and add them to stretch the number of servings and not compromise the flavour of the dish much.  Kind of depends if you are looking for something to cook really fast for supper or if you want more servings and are willing to spend a little more time doing it and save some money per serving. You can do both with this product and get good results either way.You won't be disappointed with these, in any case.  Excellent as a stock up item for the pantry.",5.0

Well, I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag.  However, once you brew it (and I let it steep a long time) you can't even taste any of the ginger.  What happened to all the spiciness?  I don't know, but it doesn't make a good ginger tea.  Furthermore, it doesn't even taste good otherwise, as it is really bland in flavor.I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea, and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste.  Personally, though, I was really let down by this tea, hence the 2-star rating.I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root.  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness, and is a whole lot cheaper.  So, if you are searching for spicy ginger tea, just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together.",2.0

4323,great flavor even better when organic,"What can I say about peppermint tea?  It hits the spot, whether hot or iced (my favorite).  I also like like combining this with green tea, or red vanilla tea.  This tea has a nice fresh flavor, and the product is made even better by being organic--so important when you are consuming something (such as a leaf) with a large surface area where contaminants reside.  Price on this product is good too.",5.0

4329,Wow.,"I got a box for just over a buck on sale to try. I don't have problems going but there are days where I barely do and it's hard so I decided to try this on one of those days. I drank before bed just like the box said, let it sit in boiling water for 15 minutes. Not even an hour after drinking the cramps started. I spent the next hour, maybe longer on the toilet. It was not fun and I was exhausted, I just wanted to sleep. Finally after going more than I ever have in my whole life. I was able to go to bed. Thankfully I did not wake up due to cramping. The next day I felt okay, then I was out shopping and lo and behold the cramps started again. I ended up going back home just to be safe. I went, and went and went throughout the afternoon, wondering when I would ever stop. I didn't stop going until in the evening.So, the reason for the two stars is the cramps. They were bad. Maybe not as bad as some I have had  before. The instructions are not exactly honest, especially how I drank the tea and not even an hour later was going. So clearly it is different for everyone, I will only drink this again if I am so constipated I haven't gone in days, that probably won't happen, but it's there, just in case. The product clearly works but the cramps just aren't worth it too me. Next time I will probably try brewing for only 5 minutes to see if this lessens the side effects. The fact that it cleans you out, is 5 stars.",2.0

4338,Dr. said not to drink,"Years ago I wrote a review singing the praises of Smooth Move, which I'd drunk for years. But two different doctors told me it probably wasn't a good idea to drink it. One reason is that it stains your colon. So when you have a colonoscopy, it's more difficult for the doctor to see what's going on in there. Also, it's a stimulant laxative, which can cause problems with regular use. I now take Miralax, which works perfectly, and the doctor says I can take as much of that as I want.",1.0

4380,Can't Live With Out This Stuff.,"So I know there is a warning that you should not drink these teas if you are pregnant or breastfeeding but I want to remind you that just about every product out there has that warning on it for legal reasons. Even their Mother's Milk tea has that warning and it is made specifically to help women increase their breast milk supply while breastfeeding. With that said...I am breastfeeding and have been for a long time. Before I found these teas I would suffer through a sore throat, stuffy nose, cold, etc with out taking medication because I didn't want my baby/toddler to get any through my breast milk. Herbal remedies are much gentler on your body so I feel very comfortable knowing that these herbs will be passed to my child instead of a strong chemical remedy like DayQuil. I make my teas very strong and add some local raw honey for even more health benefits, and it makes the teas taste even better. I do enjoy the taste of the teas much more than I thought I would since they are after all medical remedies. The teas are not miracle cures but they really do help and you don't get a doped up feeling like you do from a lot of the OTC meds out there. I'm not sure I have a favorite, I find they are all really nice to have on hand when you need them. I also enjoy just drinking them, mainly the Cold Care and Echinacea, as a nice cup of tea on a cold day.Buy one box and see what you think, I don't think you'll be disappointed.***EDIT***I just wanted to add that while in general herbs are pretty safe when breastfeeding you do not want to take them as supplements or eat/drink extremely large amounts of them with out first making sure they are safe. You would probably have to drink an entire box of this stuff in one day for it to really cause any problems with breastfeeding so if you drink the typical 1-6 cups (using 1 tea bag per cup, 6 cups steeped with 2 tea bags each might be a little much) you should be fine.***EDIT***Just found out from my midwife that although these teas are safe to drink while breastfeeding they are not safe to drink while pregnant, except for the Echinacea which is safe to drink while pregnant. Bummer! I guess my 6 boxes will be sitting in the pantry for the next 9 months.",5.0

4385,Comforting Tea Remedies,"Traditional Medicinals makes some very comforting teas. I keep a box of this tea sampler handy in case I get a cold. The ""Throat Coat"" tea is good to use when you first start feeling pain in your throat. The ""Gypsy Cold Care"" has hyssop in it which is antibacterial and antiviral. The ""Echinacea Plus"" tea also has echinacea which helps with sinus infections. When you are congested you can drink the ""Breathe Easy"" tea which has peppermint and eucalyptus in it. Some of the other ingredients in the teas include: licorice root, calendula flowers, ginger root, slippery elm, marshmallow root, wild cherry bark, fennel fruit, cinnamon bark, sweet orange peel, lemongrass leaf, elder flower, yarrow flower, rose hips, safflower petal and cloves. The teas all taste good and are very soothing.~The Rebecca Review",5.0
4391,Essential Herbal Remedy,"I was sick for quite a few days before I could get back to the store and get myself some of this tea. I tried a few packets in another sampler box and was impressed.Once I realized this tea had hyssop in it I was sold on it. Hyssop is known for helping you overcome colds. The deal is hyssop has antiviral properties. For this reason you should not drink this tea on a regular basis but rather save it for when you get a cold. Hyssop should not be used for extended periods of time and should not be taken by pregnant women as it can cause miscarriage. So says one of my herbal books.This tea also contains Elder which is a known gypsy cure for colds. That is probably the reason this is called GYPSY cold care!The other ingredients in this tea include yarrow flower, peppermint leaf, rose hips, Saigon cinnamon bark, ginger, safflower petals, cloves and licorice. It is a good tasting tea and seems to be very healing.Three days after I started drinking about three cups a day my cold went away. I will now keep this on hand and start drinking it the minute I get a sore throat! I'm very convinced that this tea helped me get well.Please consult with your doctor before taking herbal remedies!~The Rebecca Review",5.0

4406,not bad,"I cannot drink a lot of strong tea while nursing. My metabolism is all messed up. This tea is strong tasting enough that it feels like a good cup of tea. It does seem to increase supply, so I do not use if engorged. There is an anisette flavor in it. Not a flavor I am normally fond of, but I don't mind it in this tea.",4.0
4408,Does increase milk supply,"This really helped to increase my milk supply.  The taste wasn't so great for me, kind of a black licorice flavor but you get used to it. Also, it changes your body odor (might sound strange), but it makes it sweet smelling---kind of like maple syrup. One thing I did not like though was that it increased my appetite.  I mean DRASTICALLY increased my appetite.  I believe fenugreek was the culprit for the appetite increase, and I am positive it was for the body odor change.  Anyway, I used this tea for about 8 months, worked pretty well for its main purpose of milk production.",3.0
4412,Seems to work and tastes good (and it's cheap!),"This is a review for 2 types of nursing tea - Mother's Milk and Ypgi Nursing Tea, I prefer Mother's Milk because it tastes much better and is a lot cheaper on Amazon.  I am really not sure how well either of them work - I think the extra water you drink with the tea helps too.  I also take some supplements and have tried the tincture.Mother's Milk tea seems to work pretty well although I think a lot of it has to do with drinking extra water with the tea.  It has a really great (but strong) fennel taste and has a ton of other good stuff in it.  I am not really sure how well it works, my milk supply is so variant because I am generally not a very disciplined pumper (I work A LOT as an Ob resident.)  It definitely doesn't hurt and it tastes pretty good, so it gets my vote.Yogi Nursing Tea tastes terrible, it is almost yeasty and smells aweful too.  It is also a lot more expensive.  I can't imagine that either of them actually works better than the other so I would go with the Traditional Medicinals Mother's Milk.",5.0
4413,Didn't increase milk!!!!,I bought the 6 pack and followed the direction. The tea tastes great but it didn't increase my breast milk. I didn't have any luck with this product!,2.0
4414,"Good tasting, and generally effective","Mother's Milk Tea, by Traditional Medicinals, is a common drink of nursing moms wanting to maintain a healthy milk supply. The tea relies on the herbs fennel, aniseed, and coriander, believed to increase milk production. I like that Traditional Medicinals uses organic, vegan, non-GMO, pharmacopoeial-grade herbs (at least in the organic version of the tea, which is the only one that I have seen sold for some time now).To use the tea properly, it needs to be steeped, which can be a minor inconvenience, but necessary to get the full effect. The teabag should be added to 8 oz. of boiled water and steeped covered for 10 minutes. If you plan to drink a lot of medicinal teas like this, it's probably worth investing in a teacup with a cover - otherwise, covering the cup with a flat coaster, plate or saucer works just fine. Once uncovered, it will probably take between 5 and 20 minutes before it's cool enough to drink.I think the tea is really delicious, with the caveat, that in order to enjoy it, you must like the flavor of black licorice due to the aniseed. If you don't *like* licorice, you need to at least be able to tolerate it, or you'll never get this tea down! I drink it with nothing added, but it could also be lightly sweetened with some honey or agave nectar if it's too bitter for you.So the big question is...does it work? As with anything medicinal or herbal, in the western or eastern tradition, some things will work for some and not for others. I can tell you that I personally do see a direct effect from this tea. At the beginning, I would drink a cup and quickly notice the increase. As nursing has gone on, the effect is more subtle, but definitely noticeable. I drink one cup a night simply because I believe this is a healthy herbal preparation to support milk supply, and it supports my supply through night nursing. I usually increase that to two a day while menstruating, because my supply drops slightly during that time. When my baby is sick or going through some other increased nursing period, or if I cave in to an illness and take a decongestant, I will increase it to three or more.If you are having (or think you might be having) true milk supply issues, though, this tea alone will probably not have enough of an effect to correct the problem.Amazon's subscribe and save program offers as good a price as I have seen on it anywhere.",5.0
4415,Didn't work for me but worth a shot,"This did nothing for me, as far as I could tell...  and I was drinking 5 bags a day.  But on the plus side, the flavor wasn't too bad - I wouldn't pick it over one of my favorite teas just for drinking, but with a little turbinado sugar and milk, it was quite tolerable - unlike some medicinal teas I've had!  I am not a fan of licorace and feared this would be nasty to drink but it wasn't bad.  Worth a shot - great if it works for you, but if it doesn't, there are other things to try.  (Motherlove tintures seemed to boost my supply very well when this tea and fenugreek capsules didn't work)",3.0
4416,"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.","I think that the only reason why this works for some people is because they are adding more liquid to their diet when they add this tea.  I was already a seriously lengthy water drinker and this made no difference to my milk production.  I am convinced that my epidural screwed my chances of breastfeeding easily.  I used pumps, which obviously work better than baby... but, even then my milk wasn't what it should have been.  My mother, grandmother, and aunts were all pretty surprised at the lack of milk I was producing, considering my healthy organic lifestyle and my large water and liquid intake.Oh well.  I tried this stuff for 3 months to no avail.",3.0
4417,"Taste is ok with honey, results so-so","I didn't notice a huge increase in milk unless I drank a lot, which I think can be atrributed to more fluids going in than the ingredients themselves.

4449,"There Ought To Be No ""U"" (or ""K"") in Yogi","There's a lot of talk about echinacea being a lot of hooey when it comes to helping cure or reduce a cold and it's probably true, except this tea contains a lot of organic kombucha, spearmint leaf, lemongrass as well as green tea -- in addition to echinacea, with a nice tangerine tang to it, so you really feel you're getting relief for your cold with this tea. You don't have to rely upon the mythical effects of echinacea to receive benefits from this tea and enjoy it.And it is enjoyable to sip and it's sumptuous when raw unfiltered honey is added to it.It smells and tastes good and it warms the throat like a good brandy. I really do feel that it supports the immune system.The only problem I have with this tea is the Yogi tea company that provides the product. It thinks extortion is somehow proper, so it colludes with the kosher mafia to put a damn &#34;U&#34; with a circle around it as a symbol on the box, an icon the cost for which is passed off onto the unsuspecting consumer in order to support an organization of rabbis who also do not provide a health service to the individual consumer. That's really a raw deal for us. This costly symbol conveys no help benefits and simply comprises an involuntary kosher tax.Non-Jewish Americans need no rabbi's ratings.  This company needs to find a better way. Maybe put a &#34;W&#34; for White people or a &#34;C&#34; for Christians. And an &#34;M&#34; for Muslims.

Unfortunately, I purchased two boxes at a time. It's going to take a while to get it all down, but I guess I will eventually do so.-Update: 5/17/13 - Generally I drink my teas unsweetened, which resulted in my atrocious experiences with this particular tea. Since I had such a good quantity in supply and couldn't bear to throw it all away, I made a cup today sweetened with Splenda. That made a mountain of difference. I still won't say it is my favorite tea, but the sweetness took the disgusting edge off what I found initially unpalatable and nauseating.

While I was looking intosome new blends I came across a few reviews that made me angry at myself because I stopped closely monitoring their labels because I had developed a trust for this brand.This is what I found when I started digging#1 almost none of the ingredients are Organic like they used to be#2 The company had a hostile takeover in 2010 where the widow of the of the founder was defrauded by forged documentsresulting in several lawsuits. (source wikipedia)#3 They are now using so called natural flavors. If you watch Dr. Oz you will know there is nothing natural about what they can doto your body, they pose many health concerns and there are now scientific studies to show this.#4  Gross out alert !  those with religious & ethical food concerns such as Kosher, Halal, & Vegetarians should know alongwith the rest of us that beaver anal ( yes a beaver BUTT) secretions are used as Vanilla, Strawberry and Raspberry naturalflavoring called  Castoreum.

4568,Great taste,"I really love this tea. I have been on quite a tea kick lately, and I like to have a detox blend on hand. I love the slightly spicy taste of this tea. It does not require any sweetener. I am not quite sure if it is in fact detoxing me, but I really need a flavored drink instead of drinking water all the time. A great Yogi tea :)",5.0

4574,mixed feelings about this one,"I am drinking this right now and am kind of undecided how I feel about it.  The licorice flavor is strong, and it's not a flavor I'm normally fond of when I find it in tea.  But it's not as bad here as in other teas I've had.  I can taste a hint of spice (clove, cardamom, cinnamon) and that may be improving the flavor for me.  I'm not familiar with all of the other ingredients, but I don't notice any odd or unrecognizable flavors, so I guess the overall blend works well (if you can stand the licorice).The licorice root likely does have some effect on the liver.  Please see the comments below for a link to a web page from the National Institutes of Health regarding the safety of licorice.  Probably in small amounts and/or for only a few weeks at a time, this ingredient will not cause problems.  However, if you have hypertension or are pregnant, you will want to avoid this tea.  It also may interfere with the action of some prescription drugs (many of which are processed by the liver).My main criticism is that there isn't any documented medical or scientific need to do any kind of detox.  Please see the comments below for a link from the Mayo Clinic about detox diets.  Your liver and kidneys are already optimized for removing dangerous substances from the body and if you think your liver or kidneys are not functioning optimally, it's probably best to consult a medical doctor.  Additionally, because this is a tea, the amounts of the active ingredients may vary from cup to cup, depending on the temperature of the water, how many bags you brew at once, and how long you steep the tea.  So you may be getting different amounts of the ingredients at different times.In the end, whether or not to consume this tea is up to you.  If this is something you're interested in, I encourage you to investigate the ingredients further.  Personally, I don't believe detox is necessary and will probably not drink this tea frequently, for that reason.  Also, I am not a fan of licorice in tea, although, as I said earlier, this is one of the more tolerable licorice-containing teas I've tried.  2.5 stars.",3.0

4580,UGH  Yogi Teas taste awful,"I guess it's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I wouldn't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it. Okay - there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high :-) I've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible.  If I don't like something or I have an allergic reaction (which I frequently have from foods or preservatives) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money isn't wasted but this, I threw away, every last package.  Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities. YUCK!",1.0

4584,The worst Yogi Tea flavor,"First I have to say that I love Yogi tea. I love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable! This one, however, is horrible. I guess if you love licorice root you will like it, but I do not. I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud, but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not.Please do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead- terrific taste, which tastes like green tea with berries in it- a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it. This Fasting tea has a bitter after taste, which is all licorice root. Stay clear of this flavor but do buy Yogi Tea. I feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags, as it is; so profound!Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan""The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart.""""The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment.""""Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace.""""Laugh because that is your purpose in life.""Happiness is every human beings birthright.""

I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more.

4637,Ok tea but.......,"This tea has too many different things in it.  When I look for a green tea, I want just green tea and not several different other herbs.  The taste on this isn't bad, but I got much better results as far as energy and lifted mood with another green tea that I was using that was 100% nothing added.This particular tea also has burdock root in it.  This herb can be strong, so you can only take a few tea bags of this a day to keep from getting sick.  Taking too many herbs a day will make you nauseous, as I felt taking this tea several times a day.  It's too strong.I would've been happier if this was just green tea and maybe the lemongrass that they added, and that's it.In order to reap the full benefits of green tea, you have to drink several cups throughout the day.  One or two cups of this won't do the trick, therefore you cannot have too many other herbs in this.  Therefore, I will have to give this a lower rating.Ingredients;LemongrassGreen tea leafLicorice rootJasmine green teaAlfalfa leafBurdock rootDandelion rootGrapeseed extractIrish MossAmla",2.0
4640,Low grade green tea,"Brewed and tasted a wide range of mass produced green teas, including Yogi.Large scale production for mass consumption results in a very low-grade tea quality, and a low price.Mass production results in a depletion of the natural nutrients.This enables low prices, while the benefits are very limited, or absent.The enormous varieties of low-grade teas are typically grown at lower altitudes where the plants are pruned to create the maximum yield, via larger leaves. The processing is rapid to lower cost, and to establish large scale distribution.Quality is compromised.Cultivation, processing, and packaging of green teas to preserve the rich antioxidant profiles created by nature, is an exquisite art form.An excellent rendition of this exquisite art form is realized in the high-quality, Matcha and Sencha tea offerings from Kyoto, Japan, by Maison Tea Ikkoku.Green teas, by Maison Tea Ikkoku reflect a celestial combination of excellent quality, flavor, and vibrant well-being.Enjoy.",2.0

The tea contains grapeseed and amla extract which are natural antioxidants, so drinking this also has detoxifying benefits. The herbs contained in this tea are mostly organic, i.e. organic lemongrass, organic green tea leaf, organic licorice root, jasmine green tea leaf, organic alfalfa leaf, organic burdock root, organic dandelion root, and irish moss powder. There is a small amount of caffeine in this tea, about 21 mg which is still way less than the amount of caffeine found in regular coffee. I love it!",5.0

4703,"Impressive Cup of Tea, Could Be Helpful with Women's Health Issues","*****This Woman's Dong Quai Tonic from Yogi Tea is for hormone balance. I'm pretty finicky with my tea tastes and I like it. It has an herby and slightly spicy, slightly sweet taste to it that makes it a pleasure to drink. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for overall health and fatigue relief. It is stronger that way, and more intense of an experience, although it still tastes great with just one bag. I'd been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this tea.Woman's Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and is organic.The ingredients in Woman's Dong Quai Tonic are: dong quai root extract, juniper berry extract, and a proprietary blend of herbs, including all organic: cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, chamomile flower, dandelion root, anise seed, stinging nettle leaf, dong quai root (I guess as opposed to the extract), black pepper, and orange oil. Amazingly, I can taste some of these, like the chamomile, and the anise seed and the ginger, making for a lovely and complex cup of tea. I'm impressed!Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Organic Woman's Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue, restore your energy and balance a woman's hormones. This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as ""blood deficiency,"" resulting from stress, poor digestion, or improper eating and health habits. We've included in our tonic the potent ""Queen of Herbs"" Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis), shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs, addressing common female hormone imbalances, helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building all-around health. Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine (1995) indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions, including minor symptoms of PMS (such as mild mood changes) and menopause (such as hot flashes). This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body, as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance. According to yogic wisdom, women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers. A woman can choose to be balanced, happy and healthy. Choose to drink a daily cup of Woman's Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy, beautiful, graceful self."" I don't know about that, but I do like the tea, and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes (I've been having fewer...whether or not it's due to the tea, I don't know!), which is why I bought it---for menopausal support.There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Highly recommended.*****",5.0

My sister-in-law made some for a party, and it was the best I had ever eaten.  I asked her what her secret was, and she ran down the usual list of potato salad ingredients.  Then she told me she added Old Bay Seasoning.  Bingo!  That was it.I went straight home and made my homemade potato salad, grabbed my can of Old Bay, and sprinkled away.  I can't say exactly how much I use, because I never measure ingredients when I'm making my own recipes.  Just add some, stir it up, and taste....add some, stir it up, and taste till you like it.  The seasoning does not overpower the salad flavor at all, just enhances it.  Don't be concerned that there is going to be a crab or shrimp taste to your salad; it isn't the Old Bay that makes crabs and shrimp taste like seafood.  Old Bay just makes seafood taste better, and now potato salad too.  Try it on your homemade potato salad; I think you'll love it.",5.0

4828,Good for what it is,"I love tea and wanted to give loose leaf a try. However, loose leaf tea can be pretty expensive and I'm picky with tea. Not a connoisseur at all, just flat out picky. This pack seemed perfect! It was cheap and I would be able to have a variety of teas. I received black tins that included:Lung Ching (dragon well green)Pu-erhJasmineLychee BlackTikuanyin (oolong variety)OolongSo far I've only tried the Tikuanyin but it's decent. Again, as I'm new to loose leaf I might not be the best judge but I find the flavor pleasing. There are stems in all of the tins and some of them are quite big. To their credit the tins are filled to the brim with tea. In the end I think you really get what you pay for. The tea is nice enough but not as high brow as typical loose leaf teas.**Update**Taken down to two stars. The more tea I try the less I like it. I'm probably going to end up throwing all of these out. You're better off buying bagged tea; it's a higher quality!Lychee had a highly metallic taste to it. Took two sips and threw the rest out.Lung Ching was bland and had a dull flavor. Not at all bright and clean as tea normally is. Seemed maybe it was old and stored poorly.Pu-erh was alright, nothing special. (I'm new to Pu-erh tea so I may not be the best judge on this one. I enjoy Foojay Dim Sum Pu-erh quite a bit. This was like a toned down version).I found the more of this I drank the more stems I was picking out. Seemed to be almost half stems.",2.0
4829,This is going back,"In reading the reviews it seems some people have received okay tins and some of us have received smelly, moldy, stale, horrible tasting tea.  I usually read all the negative reviews and I did this time but ordered it any way hoping I'd be one of the lucky ones. Besides I don't know a whole lot about how Chinese teas are supposed to smell or taste.  I smelled every can and some were okay but most had a strange smell that I would call musty.  I figured the proof was in the tasting.  I made a cup of oolong tea, the one Chinese tea with which I am a little familiar and had to throw it out.  It tasted worse than it smelled.  The tins are cute and I almost kept the tea so I could have the tins, but common sense says there is no use keeping something when it smells so strange.",1.0
4830,Decent Tea - Even If Samples Are Random,"I converted to drinking only loose leaf tea last year and gave this gift pack a try. While it was decent, I have since had better and will probably not be ordering it again.For one, it is impossible to tell the age of the teas in the tins. For Pu-erh, that's not such a big deal, but for green teas and the Jasmine, you want normally want to get a batch that is a fresh as possible. PierMall is a big reseller of products from around the world, and there is no telling how long what you get had been sitting in some huge warehouse, slowly losing flavor. Another consideration is that you get a random sampling of Chinese teas, no the specific types that is implied by their Amazon listing. If you visit their website, you will see that they draw from this selection:* China Black Tea* Tiekuanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)* Oolong* Lung Ching DragonWell Green Tea* Yunnan Pu-erh* Jasmine Tea* White Tea* PuErh Tea with Chrysanthmum* Lychee Black Tea* Rose Black Tea* Rose Green Tea* Osthsmum Green TeaI don't know about you, but I'd like a little more certainty when buying a product. If you are new to tea and trying different varieties out, or are getting this as a gift, then it isn't such a big deal. Of what I received, the Oolong was the best. The Pu-erh was okay, though nothing special, and the Jasmine has a slight aftertaste, leading me to believe it was artificially flavored. Good Jasmine tea should be flavored by the scent of the flower, nothing else. The green and blacks were just okay.You could do worse if you were to buy teabags, but not much. I would recommend buying good loose leaf tea from dedicated tea vendors who are more upfront about what exactly they are selling you. At this price, you really can't expect to get quality tea. But if you are looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who doesn't know their tea, you could do worse. At least afterward you have some cute little tins in which to store future teas! It may cost a little more, but I think one would be much better served by ordering samples from a company like Heavenly Teas or Adagio.",3.0

4879,Lacks flavor,"When I read the positve reviews on this product, I ordered it.  It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium,  this soup would fit the bill.  If you are just trying to cut back on salt, again this soup will work fine.  I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try.  I like the convenience of it being ready to serve but I must admit, it has very little flavor.  It's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste.  Truthfully, I miss the salt.  I think that soup, generally, needs salt but as I stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland.  When I added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference.  Also, I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin.  I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial.  I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes.  I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products.  However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful.  I give Campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious.  More companies should do the same.  Salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go a long way.",2.0

I scoop up the newly made chicken salad with saltine, Ritz, or butter club crackers.  Ta-da, instant protein-filled meal.  This chicken would be great for serving to kids, too.  I ALWAYS have cans of this in my cupboards.  I can add some more flavor by adding ground black pepper, mustard, relish, and other kitchen staples.It is cheaper at my local stores.

I am not exaggerating when I say that there is nothing much bigger than a grain of rice in this soup. At first I didn't like the texture of the chowder, but now I kind of like it because all the tiny bits in it makes the seem a bit thicker. If you like big chunks of potato and clams you will not find it here.I believe that the other reviewer that talked about the chunks of potato etc. probably has tried Campbell's other microwavable Clam chowder which does indeed have big chunks, but I don't think that reviewer has eaten the Soup at Hand version of the chowder.",3.0

The soup at hand servings are perfect.  The taste is creamy, the consistency is smooth...it pretty delicious for something that comes in a can.Downsides: For a small container of soup, it sure packs a punch of your suggested daily sodium intake (~30%) and it has more calories than I expected (190 cals).  In the future, I would rather get the classic tomato soup and make it creamy on my own by adding a dollop of sour cream (or better yet, greek yogurt) for a much lower calorie, but still creamy, tomato soup.",4.0
4920,Pretty Bland but Okay,"I was surprised at how bland this is.  The texture is also a bit odd.The so-called cheese flavor was nonexistent, and the bacon flavor is very, very faint.  Even the potato flavor is really bland.The texture isn't a smooth puree like a typical &#34;cream of&#34; soup; it is filled with what resemble mashy bits of baked potato.  That doesn't ruin it, but I'd prefer the smooth style, or at the most have a little texture from some bacon bits.The product design is thus:  You have a nice, sturdy cup, with a somewhat non-spill red cap.  Shake the cup to mix; remove the red cap; peel off a foil seal; heat in the microwave for 1-2 minutes; let stand for 1 additional minute in the microwave; then replace red cap.Note that the cup retains a metal ring around the lip, which personally unnerves me as I don't like putting anything with metal on it into the microwave.  I assume that, if Campbell's markets it as microwaveable, then it must be okay.  I haven't had one spark or catch fire.  Yet.The cup does not get too hot to hold, and the red cap works well for drinking the soup, although I wouldn't rely on it in the non-spill department.  Note that the cup is filled to the very brim, which means you have to handle it carefully to avoid spilling during preparation.  There is no room to add any extras (like, something that will give it flavor).  You have to consume enough of the soup to create space if you want to add anything to it.On the plus side:  It's filling; doesn't taste very chemically; has only 130 calories; is easy to stash at work or wherever; and if you are dieting, you could have this, and possibly something like crudites, fruit, or a salad with it, and still stay under 200 calories for a meal, which is excellent on a diet.  You could use it for lunch to save up calories if you are going to a party or a special dinner.So - it's not a bad product, just in my opinion definitely needs some flavor doctoring.",3.0
4923,CONSUMER ALERT; NO INGREDIENTS STATED UPFRONT.SUGAR SUGAR,"As a consumer, it is my right to know what ingredients are in the products I buy. I find it very DECEPTIVE that Campbells products do NOT LIST upfront WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE IN EACH OF THEIR PRODUCTS. So, you have to go online elsewhere and lo and behold; SUGAR IS IN THE FIRST INGREDIENTS!!!!!!! Consumers beware that sugar is the NUMBER ONE ADDITIVE used by Campbells and it is the NUMBER ONE ADDICTIVE substance that people suffer from.  Read labels. Campbells ought to know better to be upfront--- and stop loading up the consumers with sugar instead of REAL TOMATO, pure vegetable ingredients. And, in case anyone wants to be informed, there are many DECEPTIVE LABELS MANUFACTURERS USE TO call sugar AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME CHEMICALLY; SUCH AS DEXTROSE, MALTODEXTRIN, SUCROSE, SUCRALOSE, CORN SYRUP, ORGANIC sugar (I love this one, so it is made without fertilizers,---- NOTHING IS HEALTHY ABOUT SUGAR)",1.0
4925,Don't put this container in the microwave,"I bought these because they're supposed to be quick and easy meals for work. The 'Vegetable with Mini Round Noodles' is also vegetarian, which is another reason why I bought it.

If you place it in the microwave as the directions call for, the container will 'pop' and fall over, spilling soup all over the microwave. I thought it was a fluke the first time, so I wiped everything up and put it back in. It 'popped' and fell over three more times.Given the fact that the purpose of buying these containers is for convenience, I don't think it's very convenient to have to bring an extra bowl to work to pour the soup into before heating it up.That said, the price and the taste is what prompted me to buy another package. Yes, you have to pour it out into a bowl, but it's a quick, cheap, and pretty decent meal. I recommend it if you don't mind bringing an extra bowl to work.",3.0

The only downfall to these cups is that even though I mixed it up good after microwaving, the noodles stay on the bottom once you are done sipping it.

4962,Can never get to the noodles...,"While I like that this is low sodium and kind of handy on the go, I've had to learn a few things the hard way with this product:Definitely hold it upside down and shake it up a lot before you microwave it, otherwise the carrots will revolt and explode at the bottom and tip the whole cup over, spilling all the product all over your microwave.  Not fun to clean up, especially at work with everyone laughing at you.No matter how hard you try, all you will get while sipping through the cup is broth and maybe 7-10 mini round noodles.  All the rest retreat to the bottom of the cup and stay there so you have to pop off the top and scoop out the noodles with a spoon.  Which completely defeats the purpose of this being an on-the-go product.If you're really lazy but still want those noodles, cover the little hole at the top of the sippy cup, tilt it fully vertical over your head, and while holding the larger hole on the cup over your mouth give a few good whacks to the bottom which will dislodge the stubborn noodles at the bottom and move them closer to the top.  You'll still only get about 10 more noodles but it makes you feel like you've succeeded at something while trying to eat lunch.Probably won't buy these again unless I'm getting something that doesn't have the noodles in it.

This is the second time I've opened a shirataki noodle package expecting to be knocked back by a horrible smell, only to smell nothing but a mild odor reminiscent of some soy-based product.As for the noodles themselves, the texture didn't have that strange ""cartilage-like"" feel of fettucine-style Miracle Noodles. However, they were very rubbery and stretchy, requiring a lot of chewing. Personally, I found nothing offensive about this texture but those expecting it to have the consistency of spaghetti might find themselves disgusted or just plain disappointed by it, since these are being touted as a substitute for pasta.Flavor-wise, these noodles have none. This poses a huge problem for those hoping to turn to them to ""lose weight."" This becomes all too apparent when you come across recipes from other users for this product. More often than not, the recipes often call for rich, fattening sauces; meats, fish, seafood; and other ingredients that usually bump up the calories a hundred-fold. (One recipe I saw-- kid you not-- involved fried pork sausage!}Why do recipes for shirataki noodles tend to go overboard? Well, since they have no flavor, you can't just boil them up as you would other noodles and eat them with a basic soup base or sauce. You have to literally drown them in tons of other stuff to make them filling. So whatever health benefits you gain by substituting carbs with these shirataki noodles is canceled out by the calories and sodium you wind up tacking on from the sauces and other junk you have to add to make them ""work.""All in all, a ""so-so"" product-- not bad, not great. Adventurous chefs and eaters who like to try new things may get a kick out of them, because of the interesting texture and cooking challenge they pose. Dieters on the other hand may want to steer clear. Because these noodles have no taste, they'll find themselves needing to add so many ingredients that they may as well just be cooking a ""regular"" meal with these as nothing more than a side dish. In addition, this product isn't necessarily the best substitute for pasta, because the texture couldn't be more different. Three stars.",3.0
4981,Ordered on Jan 23 still have yet to receive,"I place my order on Janaury 23 for the noodles.  Due to overwhelming demand the supplier ran out and I had to wait for restocking.  Once the item was restocked, 2/9, I was sent an E-mail with a link to UPS.  After a few days, 2/13, the status of my package went from ""receiving billing information"" to ""exception"".  The package was damaged in transit and has yet to be replaced, it's now 2/23.  Seller is so-so about responding to communication (they usually respond it's just they are not quick about it) and until I actually receive the product, I am very hesitant to use this seller again.",2.0
4984,Tasted fishy,"I really tried to like this product, but couldn't stomach it.  I did rinse the noodles a lot, as recommended, but they just smelled faintly of bad fish to me. -And I like fish!- I was really excited to try this product because I have heard a lot of good things about it and was very eager to find a low cal alternative to traditional noodles, but this just wasn't for me.",2.0
4991,"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.","I very much wanted to like tofu shirataki noodles. Unfortunately, they are just a little too unusual for my taste. They're not awful, but the texture is very slippery and chewy. As was mentioned in other reviews, even after rinsing and soaking they still have a distinctive smell and taste. A sesame-soy based sauce seems to compliment the shirataki noodles best. (i.e., masks the taste) Spaghetti sauce just doesn't taste right with it. Since this product is not available locally and has to be shipped from New York to Texas at a net cost of about $5 a package, I would be very unlikely to purchase it again.",3.0
4992,Texture twist,Don't expect pasta! Expect a different texture and rinse well. Use with chic broth or saut&eacute;ed garlic and veggies. Nice addition to the no carb/ low carb style,5.0
4999,I dislike this,When I first cut open the bag and have this miracle shiritaki noodle washed the smell of it was very mild like salmon after that I boiled it for a good 3 minutes then run it down with cold water then I put it on a flat plate to patted dry with a paper towel once it is dry I cook it with some recipes I got on YouTube  the flavor of the sauce and other stuff I cook with was good however chewing on the noodles was like biting down on a rubber band and it was difficult for me to even swallow the noodles down soon after that I threw it back up after that I threw it all the noodles away even I though I wasted my money on this noodle it is not worth trying I don't recommend it !,1.0

ONE GREAT BIG FAT STAR!",1.0
5017,three and a half stars really....,These crackers have a nice texture - crisp and just a little flaky. They are a bit on the salty side and are good paired with creamier cheeses that will cut a little of the salt.The butter taste is a more akin to a margarine flavor which is where this cracker looses points with me. Kind of like if you tried to make a croissant with oil - just not quite what's called for. These would be much better with an authentic butter taste.,3.0
5020,Club Crackers,I ordered these without really checking the brand name.  They are Keebler brand.  They don't taste as I expected.

That might be average or even low, but I was hoping for fewer. Perhaps crackers aren't in my future!Got a good price too, $8.50 on subscribe and save, but I think I won't keep this subscription.Ha, sorry for the boring review, but I am just not enthused about these.",3.0

I really wanted to like these, especially considering that I  bought a case.  I cannot find it locally, so had to try it here.  I was extremely disappointed.They are over the top sweet.  I will give them to the grandkids and see if they like them.  If not, I will donate the unopened to the church pantry.  I know others will appreciate them.I hope Murray reads this and cuts back on the sweetness, so I can enjoy a diabetic friendly shortbread cookie or gives a choice.",3.0
5038,Big Chocolate Taste,"I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.",5.0

I do remember it being awesome, and totally delicious, and hard to stop eating, which is why I stopped buying it. I bought a box recently, now that I'm better at portion control, and found, much to my great sadness, that it tastes totally different. The texture is also different; before it was crunchy and broke apart right away, whereas now it sort of sticks together more and is a lot less crunchy. I found it so much less good that I'm not even eating it, and am trying to slough it off onto my husband, who is less picky about food in general.",1.0

5068,Bean taste. Big let down.,"There is no smoke or burger taste at all in this. This was a big let down.  There is an overwhelming bean taste. Reminds me of Hot dog chili without the chili powder.

So the  only use for this is chili or no meat sauce.If you want a burger or burger sub, then do not buy.Should call it redi ground.",1.0

5089,What Happened to the Flavor?,"I used to buy this all the time & I grew up eating it & a lot of the other Loma Linda/Worthington products. It seems somebody has messed with the recipe for this one, again! It never did taste like real chicken, but it always had a very good flavor for what it is, a meat analog. Unfortunately, this last case I have just received is missing something...The flavor! We have already tried 3 cans of it, thinking that maybe it was just a fluke for one or 2 cans, but apparently it's the ""NEWEST"" version because each can is the same, tastless! The gravy is a lot thinner too & also missing the flavor! We went through this a couple years ago when the manufacture basically ruined our favorite meat analog, the Loma Linda Redi-Burger! Our last 2 cases of the Redi-Burger was nothing but a mushy, odd tasting mess, nothing like it used to be! It went from being a solid product that you could slide out of the can & slice to a disgusting, Sloppy-Joe consistency that tasted bitter & weird.  Now I guess the manufacture is determined to ruin the Fried Chik'n too! This last case of the Fried Chik'n has about the same texture as it used to have; sort of chewy; but the flavor is totally gone! I suspect the manufacture was trying to reduce the high salt content, but the flavor went out the door too. I don't think we will be buying this one anymore & I'm going to cancel our subscription to it. For the high price these items are, they are so not worth it any more! VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!",3.0
5091,Vegetarian Fast Food,"This product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan, and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce.

They arrived very quickly as I live in Illinois where they are made. They are fresh, have the crunch, have the appearance of old fashioned ginger snaps, but there is no flavor at all. Believe me, please, if you are looking for the decided taste of ginger and molasses you can avoid these.

5136,"It's OK enough, but not something I'd buy again","I'm a huge fan of jerky and if not for the high sodium content in it (among other things), I'd probably eat this every day. I wasn't expecting a miracle from this jerky, just something good enough that could help tide me over as far as jerky went.Here's the thing, though: it's just not that good of a jerky. It's a very soft jerky and the meat felt like it'd been processed a little too much before it'd been dried because it had that mushy texture to it. This in itself isn't enough to put me off entirely, though. It's not an unforgivable obstacle.What got me was the taste. There's definitely a pepper taste here, but it's pretty bland overall and it's not really all that satisfying of a jerky experience. I remember eagerly ripping into that first bag and kind of giving a ""eh, it's not great but it's not awful either"" shrug. I gave some to my mother to try, who ended up saying the same thing.If you're looking for a low sodium jerky, this is probably one of the lowest sodium pre-packaged jerky products out there, but it's just not all that great. I'll finish what I bought, but this just wasn't something I'd consider buying again. I've discovered that Jack Links has a low sodium beef jerky, which is actually not that bad. I'd absolutely recommend that over this.",2.0
5137,odd texture but I like them,"These definitely have a texture different than other jerkies.  They really fall apart in the mouth, unlike other jerkies where you might chew forever and still have bits that you just have to spit out.  You can easily tear these apart by hand, whereas other jerkies usually need a knife to cut.  It took a bit of getting used to because it was so different - at first I didn't like them but now they're fine.  And I like the really low salt, low sugar flavor.",3.0

But once I took a couple of sips, the warmth of the ginger, and the sweet taste of honey, all combined and cleared my sinuses, soothed my sore throat, and made me feel really relaxed. Now, it just smells like ginger and honey to me, and I know it will make me feel better.I also drink it when I have an upset stomach. The ginger makes you feel like all your stomach muscles relax and it warms you up from the inside. It settles queasiness too.But don't just think of this as a medicinal drink. It's tasty, and is a great addition to my collection of tea. Even when I'm not feeling a cold or a stomach ache, it's a great way to warm up and relax!",5.0

I think the salt has a wonderful mild flavor and I know my body is benefiting from all the minerals that are in it.However, I have one MAJOR issue with this product and that is the fact that it contains a lot of hard crystals, some send, etc. These crystals do not dissolve and if you bite on it, it will sound crunchy and even painful.Unfortunately, I've tried this product on 4 different occasions to make sure it wasn't just a bad batch, and they all had crystals that don't dissolve.I'm sad to report that I chipped two of my teeth over a period of 2 months. The chips are microscopic, but I do have quite a bit of sensitivity in those teeth. Also, if your teeth are naturally prone to sensitivity, I would presume this product would irritate them even more.Great idea, but the filtration process leaves little bit too much of inpurities behind.",2.0

Also, they nor real weiners have the savory flavor of Big Franks to me. Some people don't like their veggie dogs soft. For those who want their veggie dog to taste exactly like the real thing, I would reccomend another product from this same company - Morning Star Farms veggie dogs. They're in the frozen breakfast section of your local grocery store. They are firm just like real weiners and they have the exact same taste. However, I prefer Big Franks to both of these veggie dogs.",3.0
5286,Very Tasty!,"Our family loves all of the Worthington/Loma Linda products, but I was concerned about meatless hot dogs since I think most of them remind me of  Play Doh.  Fortunately, the Veja Links are very tasty and they are nice and firm like real hot dogs.  Buying these cases from Amazon Grocery is a nice deal, too.  I hope they continue to carry them!",5.0
5287,Great little veggie hot dogs,"Years ago we bought Worthington hot dogs in a can, but they were huge compared to these, so we were surprised to find less than normal sized hot dogs when we opened the can.  But they still taste the same, and are a wonderful alternative for those of us who have chosen a healthier and more humane lifestyle.  Once you slice these up, saut&eacute; them, and add them to some dish, you really can't tell they are vegetarian.  Or simply grill them and put them in hot dog buns, they look, taste, and feel a lot like the real thing...no, wait, there isn't any gristle or anything nasty in these!  They are actually a LOT better than the meat/guts based non-vegetarian dogs.  Even if I was not a vegetarian I would prefer these to the animal products.  Bon app&eacute;tit!",5.0

5292,For meat eaters and vegetarians alike,"This is another vege meat option my meat eating husband and my vegetarian self love. This is thick, and full of huge chunks of ""meat"" The flavor is like a rich chili, not too hot and I love it with vege cheese on top. It is very filling and unique to vege meats but this is one of our favorites that when we can find it and afford it, they are pricey, we will buy a few.",5.0
5293,Delicious!!,"Very good stuff.  You can even eat it right out of the can!  Sometimes I mix in a can of petite cut tomatoes and chili powder, and then sprinkle cheddar cheese on top prior to serving. This is good in tacos as well.",5.0
5294,too salty,take some of the salt out and i will give it 5 stars... it way too salty,3.0
5295,Waaay to salty to enjoy.,"I tried really hard to like the product (it comes in a case of 12 after all) but I just could not take the taste. It looks like regular chili, has some fat like regular chili, has a texture like regular chili, and it almost tastes good, if you can get past the salt.This is the second, and last, of this brand and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better, IMHO, veggie chili can be made with some diced onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, a hot chile of your choice, garlic, oregano, chili powder, a little masa, tomato paste, and one or more types of beans, like pintos, kidneys, mayo coba, etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done, or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me, so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried, vegetarian or not, this compared favorably. But, I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal breaker for me, as it is with other prepared, canned chilis.",2.0
5298,Saucettes are OK,"After reading the reviews on this site, I purchased a whole case of Saucettes off of Amazon.com. I was a little dissapointed. I was expecting them to taste just like the frozen Morning star Farms links. But, the flavor was MUCH milder than them, and I was dissapointed. They have the same flavor, but are not as spicy nor as flavorful. I tried breaking them up and using them as taco meat and they weren't so bad that way. If I could do things over again, I would have bought a can at a health food store and tried them out first. I would reccomend that others do the same since some people really like them.",2.0
5300,thumbs down,"I guess I expected more of a breakfast sausage taste. these are very like the hotdogs (which I like very much). So, if I am buying ""dogs"", I will just buy ""dogs"" in the future. I do like the other products just fine. It's great to have veg options for a quick meal!",2.0
5317,Great meat substitute for cooking,"I have to admit I was nervous to try a canned product but I was very pleased. The appearance is not great coming out of the can but when you mold it or mix it in with other foods it's just like ground beef. The taste is very subtle, almost nothing, which I think is a great benefit because it will absorb the flavor of whatever you cook with it. In general I'm very happy with this product and I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because I have never seen it in a store!",5.0
5326,Still Tough Hulls,"They need to find a strain that doesn't have such tough hulls. The best I've found is Bearitos organic, but they're in microwave bags and pricey. Someone needs to go spy on Bearitos and see what corn they are using.. (just kidding)I airpop. So the kind I get is important, the hulls aren't softened with oil during the cooking process. It's possible the process you use to pop your corn may not emphasize the hulls as much as mine does.",3.0
5331,"Organic Popcorn, all natural, non GMO!","I am always looking for foods that have not been altered in any way.  I am delighted to find this popcorn and I tested it by cooking it in 2 tablespoons of organic coconut oil in a stainless steel Great Northern popcorn popper that has a crank to keep the kernels moving in the popper.  They all popped completely, and perfectly with this organic brand.I also taste tested a store bought version of yellow popcorn for comparison.  As far as popping completely, this brand won. The store version had about 9 to 12 unpopped kernels left behind using the same method. There were also approximately 15 partially popped kernels left over with the store brand.  There were none with this organic brand. The size of the popcorn were both equal, but the hulls were more noticeable with this brand, yet they didn't seem to get caught in the teeth any more or less than the other.  Flavor was good, but not as flavorful as the store brand with nothing added to it. The texture was different from the store bought version as well.  It was less ""light"" and a bit more chewy in texture.  Nothing that would be noticeable at all for those who like the caramel version, or if you like to add salt and butter on your popcorn.I will be purchasing more of this brand.  I was somewhat concerned about the packaging, but relieved to find that it comes with its' own ziplock sealer, so no need to store it in something else to keep it fresh.  Hope this is useful in helping you decide to purchase. Enjoy!",4.0
5332,Tough and Dry,"This is just okay pop corn.  We use a stove top stainless steel popper with Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  With Arrowhead Mills Organic pop corn it makes a wonderful, tender, delicious pop corn.  With Now Foods, okay but tough and dry.",3.0

5356,FISH TASTE IS TOO STRONG,"This soup would be more rightly called FISH SOUP, rather than miso soup.  It has miso listed as one of the ingredients, but the BONITO fish overpowers everything else.  Although I like fish, I really hate this soup and I feel cheated by the money I spent on it.",1.0
5357,Bummed to discover that this contains fish :(,"I agree with the last reviewer, the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear. I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it,  now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that ""powdered bonito"" is powdered fish. It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package, but on amazon it doesn't specify this.  So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for me.(I have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago. I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants. Fish & shellfish are not the same as far as allergies, so I do not know why this sometimes happens. It could have been cross-contamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as well....In any case, I make it a point to avoid things like ""powdered fish"" in my food.)",2.0
5359,Not that impressed,"At first I really liked the first few packets I ate, but the more I ate, the less I liked it.  It's just really salty (even though I add a TON of water) and not as clean as a flavor as sushi restaurants.  I actually like the ones they have at my local grocery store better,",3.0
5360,"tasty, but......","I found this soup to be tasty, but on the salty side so I added more water to taste.  Tofu in product not impressive, but the spinach is amazing the way it hydrates into spoon size pieces.  The biggest downside is the cost.  Almost $1.45 a cup is spendy for instant soup....Cup a Soup brand (at Amazon) is about $0.30.  And bouillon is about 0.05.  If you are looking for something hot then there are other choices.  Was an interesting experience though.  Seller was great and product received quickly.",3.0

5362,Overpriced,"This product tastes just okay in comparison to the miso product from Trader Joe's. However, it is overpriced 200% compared to miso packets that you get in grocery stores (such as Trader Joe's). I received three packets and each packet contained three small pockets (about one third regular serving size). To make a decent miso soup I need 3 small pockets. Only reason, why this product is not rated with less stars is that the vendor shipped the product promptly and recieved it relatively fast.",3.0
5367,Beware = Contains MSG!,"Recently, I have been trying to upgrade my eating habits and reduce any processed food and additives from my diet. That said, I have been very careful to read labels and small print. With Miso soupls in particular, I have noticed that unless the packaging does not say 'No MSG"" in big bold letters on the front of the package, the soup contains MSG. This brand is no exception. I like the taste and was enjoying it for quite a few years until I have made this discovery. No MSG Miso soups exist but are harder to find. I usually go to specialized Asian markets to get them. This brand is the most commercially available Miso soup on the market. It's a shame that it is not the healthiest choice for those who care about what they eat.",1.0
5370,Not really an upgrade for the price,"This Enfamil formula variation, while good in terms of nutrition, ease of digestion, etc., isn't different enough from other Enfamil variations for infants with sensitive systems to merit the increase in price. The &#34;premature&#34; label adds a premium that the slight difference in nutritional value doesn't reflect.",3.0
5375,EnfaCare,"This is a difficult formula to rate.  My daughter was a month premature and was 5 lbs 14 oz at birth (5 lbs 6 oz when we left the hospital) and was put on EnfaCare for about a month because we had issues getting her to eat and she needed the extra calories.  I didn't have any issues with the formula.  It mixed well and she tolerated ti well, but did it help her catch up to her peers?  Maybe?  I don't have a control group to compare to!  I know the manufacturer says most babies who start on this stay on it for nine months.  My daughter did not.  Her pediatrician didn't feel she needed it once she hit about 8 lbs.  She is now a pre-teen and stays around the 5th percentile for height and weight.  Is this because she never caught up or because she was just destined to be a smaller person?  I believe she was just meant to be a smaller person.I now have another preemie in my care.  We'll see if the end result is different with this one!",3.0
5376,"Some corn syrup solids, i.e. fructose linked to addiction & liver damage","Enfamil EnfaCare Infant (ages 0-12 months) is characterized by milk, whey proteins, more corn syrup, less lactose, DHA, choline, vitamins, and minerals.The sugar in milk is non-sweet lactose (disaccharide), which is not absorbed into the bloodstream already in the mouth, as sweet glucose (monosaccharide), which thus is not a healthy substitute for lactose. Unfortunately, most of milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in EnfaCare and not for a polysaccharide, e.g. maltodextrin.  Corn syrup (solids) contains glucose and - like high fructose corn syrup - may contain fructose, which presence (sweetness) can be masked by adding other sugars. Scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine. So are corn syrup solids with fructose, which content is not provided on the label. Also, high intake of dietary fructose may lead to liver damage from bacteria due to their movement from gut into the blood stream and liver.So, would you like to start your child's obesity and exposure to a potential liver disease (NAFLD) when he/she is an infant, wait for later, or maybe not to accustom the child to corn syrup at all in order to avoid the fructose desire/addiction, as concentrated fructose is not common in nature, humans were not exposed to its consumption, and thus are vulnerable even those who are not obese yet?! A benefit for prematurity does not excuse beginning addition.DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) found in fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be synthesized in humans. A study found that preterm infants fed DHA had better developmental outcomes, but not the full-term infants or term infants (1-12 mo) who develop normally.  A formula for the newborn (0-3 mo) without corn syrup seems to suit better both the preterm and full-term newborns while no evidence suggests that supplementing DHA for the older infants (3-12 mo) is beneficial.Choline is found in sunflower, soy, cod fish, broccoli, cauliflower, milk, chicken, etc. Endurance athletes and people who drink a lot of alcohol may be at risk for choline deficiency and may benefit from choline supplements.Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition has 3 lines of formulas: Enfamil Newborn (ages up to 3 months), Enfamil Infant (up to 12 months), and Enfagrow Toddler Transitions (9 to 18 months) and Enfagrow Toddler Next Step Milk Drinks (1 year & up). Except Enfamil Newborn, Infant A.R. and partially EnfaCare, all milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition formulas including the Infant Soy. Enfamil Newborn is characterized by easy to digest proteins, choline, DHA, and vitamin D. Enfagrow Toddler Transitions is characterized by DHA, choline, calcium, vitamin D, and antioxidants. Enfagrow Toddler Next Step is characterized by calcium and vitamin D, and is available in two flavors: vanilla and natural milk.",3.0
5379,You're paying for marketing,"I highly recommend the regular Enfamil brand formula. My preemie thrived on it, even as she got off to a rough start with feedings. But this new version seems like more marketing wizardry than scientific innovation. The ingredient list is not substantively different from regular Enfamil, but the price is a stupendous increase. That strikes me as very disappointing and fishy.",3.0
5385,Not really that different,"I like enfamil formulas.  We've used them regularly for all of our kids.  I got this one and was surprised to see that it's not much different than the normal sensitive infant formula made by enfamil, but is more expensive.  The vitamins, fillers, etc. are almost identical to their other sensitive formulas.  Overall, I'd say just stick with the regular stuff and don't bother buying into the extra cost just b/c this one happens to say &#34;for premature Babies&#34; on it, as it is pretty much the same as every other great product enfamil makes.",3.0
5393,No more spit up!,This formula works great!  It is a bit cheaper here on Amazon than at my local Wal-mart.  It has reduced my daughters spit up greatly!  You will need a square or slit type nipple as this formula is a bit thicker than others.  Best to use warm water to mix also.,5.0
5394,Probiotics and Rice Powder,"If you have never encountered a child with a a spit up problem, you have likely never been a parent. But there is spitting up, and there is spitting up. If your child is one who spends more time spitting it up then keeping it down, you are probably at your wits end. When I was raising my daughter, one of my friends discussed &#34;projectile vomiting,&#34; and what it meant to clean baby formula off of the ceiling! Forget about &#34;not jiggling baby after he eats,&#34; they were scared to pick him up!This product has rice powder (to help thicken the formula) and probiotics (to help with digestion). While it reduces spitting up statistically by 50%, even that amount can make a huge difference to parents. I'm grateful Enfamil came out with this formula. While you can use a regular nipple, I found it needed a larger hole to accommodate the formula.",4.0
5398,Enfamil AR,"The pediatrician had me use Enfamil AR with my daughter because she was small and spit up so much.  I&#8217;m not a fan of adding rice cereal to a bottle to thicken formula.  It regularly clogged the nipple and I had guilt over force feeding her cereal.  Essentially, it was like, &#8220;If you want your bottle, you WILL eat this rice cereal too.&#8221;  (Yes, I know this is my issue and not really the norm.)  I was very pleased with the Enfamil AR.Pros:- It didn&#8217;t clog the nipples of the bottles and I didn&#8217;t have the guilt I guess because the rice was already added.- I love the idea of buying one plastic canister and then refill packs.  I recycle, but would prefer less waste upfront.  Why did companies not think of this sooner?- Formula mixed well and I had no issues with the powder.Cons:- It didn&#8217;t really help with her spitting up, but I think this is just my child.  Nothing seems to help with the spitting up.",5.0
5409,Baby didn't like,"This was clumpy and we were hopeful.  However, the baby didn't like this even as an occasional supplement to breast milk.  She gave e remainder to the neighbor who also has a bottle-fed infant who was having some reflux and gas issues. and they seem to be very pleased.  She complained about the lumps but said the baby holds it down much better than the formula they have been using.",3.0
5411,"Ok, I guess","My little one has always had trouble with the spitting up, so when I started supplementing, it only got worse.  I got this stuff b/c I thought it might help and I really didn't notice much of a difference at first (even with a slow transition) but after about a week, once she was used to this and on it completely, it cut the spit ups from like 5-8 per feeding to 3-4 per feeding.  So it is an improvement a little, but it didn't stop the spitting up completely.  Overall, it's more expensive for a little bit of an improvement, but after speaking to my doctor, ruling out allergies, etc. I was told that some babies just spit up more than others and there isn't a whole lot you can truly to do fix that, so for me this stuff wash kinda a wash.",3.0
5415,Oh wow- It works!,This is a bit thicker than other formulas and can cause some constipation so for best results I am mixing it with regular enfamil. It works for spit up but you're going to have to use bigger nipples and make some adjustments for feeding. I'd ease this into your baby's diet so that it's not a sudden change. It works great though if you have a baby who spits up a lot.,5.0
5416,A Wonderful Formula to Sooth Tummy Troubles!,"I'm soon to be a mother of 3 and my two younger children both enjoyed Enfamil Formulas. Enfamil A.R. Baby Formula Milk-Based with Iron is a special formula for colic/spit up from Enfamil.  Enfamil A.R. is a milk based formula  for babies ages 0-12months. It's extremely versatile and mixes well with cereal and oatmeal like all Enfamil/Enfagrow formulas.Like All Enfamil formulas It has extra DHA and Iron vitamins and helps support better growth, brain & eye development as well as immune system development. So your baby won't be losing out on any of the great essential vitamins and minerals needed for healthy development.Enfamil A.R. Baby Formula Milk-Based with Iron, Combo Pack, comes with 1 full 22.2 oz tub of formula as well as 3 boxes of 16.6 oz two pack refills (which easily slip into the tub once empty) . This saves you so much money because buying the tub or cans by themselves can range from 25-28 dollars each.  I would definitely recommend this formula combo pack to anyone with a special little baby.",5.0
5417,Thicker than normal,"My baby girl has spit ups every once in a while and I got this thinking that it would help. It does seem to help a little as her spit ups are less frequent. However, when she does on the occasion, her spit ups are as thick as the formula - this formula has a thicker consistency than the regular Enfamil iron-based ones.Subsequently when I consulted my pediatrician over my baby girls spit up frequency, my pediatrician wasn't too worried about her spit ups and says they are normal and suggested that we revert back to using a regular Enfamil iron-based formula and only use the Enfamil A.R. formula when her spit ups are really serious.I guess it still helps to have some A.R. formula around to deal with her spit up issues.Would recommend parents to check on severity of the infant's spit ups with your pediatrician before getting this formula.",3.0

5423,Caused my son to spit up more...,"To be honest, I tried this formula, because formula is expensive, and this one was offered to me! ;) My son(10months) has had a history of spitting up worse than either of my other two. It started as soon as he was born, and it has improved greatly as he's got older. We went to formula full time when his stomach seemed to reject my breastmilk, and he was losing a lot of weight.He's did pretty well on some of the formulas he's used. Gentlease was great, except for the fact that it cause SEVERE constipation. He did well with the regular Toddler Transitions formula, so we will keep it in mind if milk doesn't agree with him in a couple of months. He's did the best with the AR formula. We LOVE it!All of that to say that this formula caused my little one to start spitting up very soon after using it. It's definitely worth a try for babies with colic! For spitting up? I'd start with a different formula. Based on our experience, I'd recommend using AR. He's had almost no spitting up with it and no constipation.",3.0
5424,"Not really ""gentle on tummy""","Baby formulas are a roulette wheel, despite 99.975% identical ingredients apparently. The base has more impact obviously, which was why we tried soy. Baby didn't seem to mind the formula, being designed to reduce fussiness and gas, it didn't seem to do either, and at certain points seemed to make it worse. Add in that this is a brand name product, not Walmart formula, makes this rather disappointing.",3.0
5427,Try through gradual introduction and mixing to see whether this soy-based formula will cause constipation,"Be careful to introduce this soy formula gradually.  If a baby is put on it exclusively, perhaps in an effort to avoid colic-related pain, the result will likely be painful constipation.  Soy-based formula is highly identified with constipation, although some children don't have a better choice.The formulas that break milk down to a level for a baby's tummy to process it are all significantly more expensive.  This all comes down to a matter of money, and it is stressful for parents that can't afford the premium offered by each major brand.Therefore, go easy and slowly as a percentage of the formula your baby eats and eventually see if baby can consume this soy formula without the constipation.  It's worth a try.  Constipated babies will cry with all their might though.",3.0
5429,"Very tinny tasting, might not be accepted by a baby used to milk","I thought formula might be handy on the go, but the baby hates this stuff. She's fine with breast milk, cow milk, and some other formulas. She'll prett much eat anthing, food-wise. Surprised by her disgust after drinking a sip, I gave it a sniff and a taste myself. It's dreadful, really metallic tasting. Not sure if soy formula's always like this, but I have to admit I was pretty surprised it tasted like anything by sugar after reading the ingredients.2 stars instead of 1 because it does mix up really easily.If your baby has taken formula from the get-go, they may be more tolerant. We have encountered other really tinny ones from the endless stream of Enfamil samples, so I don't think it's altogether rare.",2.0
5430,"For Soy, its OK","No formula, particularly soy based, smells or tastes particularly good.  This is easy to mix up, it is well tolerated and as long as the child is unaware that better tasting food is out there, you should be pretty successful in getting it down.  This is no better or worse than others on the market and a bit cheaper than a comparable Similac product.  It is however far more expensive that the brands sold by CVS or Meijer and honestly, I think that they are just as good.",3.0

It must taste differently than normal formula. I also breastfeed regularly so I'm sure that this has affected his preferences, but our first experience with this soy based formula was not a good one.Not only did he resist taking it, but once he did it made him super gassy. That said, I've had three kids now and I feel that Enfamil is a well trusted brand. My first child would not breastfeed no matter how hard I tired, and so Enfamil and Similac were what she lived off of, but my other two babies did breastfeed so luckily I only had to use formula as a supplement in rare occasions.Enfamil is a fine brand, but I'd only recommend the soy version if your child can absolutely not tolerate regular formula, which must taste more like real milk since all of my kids have taken to regular formula with much more ease.",3.0
5440,"Leery of the Corn Syrup Solids, Does Help with Gas","First off, if you have kids and are leery of corn syrup in their diet, this is not the formula for you.  Because the primary ingredient is corn syrup, the formula is sweeter, and kids are more likely to drink it because it tastes good.  That aside, I got this formula for my nephew who's mom works full time and just doesn't have time/want to nurse.  Because my nephew is prone to gassiness, we tried out several different formulas on him to see which would work well on him.  Milk based formulas seemed to be the worse for him, so we gave soy a try.  It really did help out with his fussiness and seemed to make him more comfortable.  The formula is easy to mix up in a bottle, and we didn't have any problems with clumping or weird separation.  He had no problems drinking this formula and the gassiness seemed to be lessened.With the corn syrup issue, my sister in law is not in love with this formula, and consequently will most likely wait until he's older to use this formula more a supplement instead of giving it to him every meal.  That aside, it's a good formula and is easy on the stomach.",3.0

5444,Enfamil Prosobee Soy Infant Formula Powder with Iron,"The first ingredient is corn syrup solids 54%.  This makes my alarms kind of go off because corn syrup is such an addictive product and to be feeding it to babies in such a high amount can make them obese and refuse to take other foods unless they are sweetened.  That said, if your baby is having problems with digestion of lactose or milk proteins, then this product is worth a try.  I will also say that it's not normal to feed a human baby cow's milk but that seems to be what we do.  Breastmilk is by far the best, but that is not always possible, or in the amount needed.  And colicky babies need soothing and therefore I will recommend this product since it does not contain any milk substances and should be easier on your babies digestive system.",3.0

I make one cup of this cappuccino and pour it into the mug.2. I make a double cup using a regular, less expensive ""Podz"" brand pod (either dark coffee or one of their flavored ones) and pour it into the mug.3.

You can take a normal med. roast pod, make a half cup and fill the rest with your own skim milk, sugar and vanilla creamer and it tastes better.

It's essentially carbonated and sweetened white grape juice from concentrate with some added ""energy"" ingredients.I don't mind the taste at all.  I don't find it particularly refreshing, mind you, but I certainly don't consider it bad.  It's sweet enough (but not overly so) that I can drink it down without any trouble.  At 8.4 ounces, it's a good quantity that's easy to drink, won't fill you up, but also isn't a small shot that leaves you feeling wanting.Now...for the energy part of it.  I tried this for the first time in the afternoon on a day when I was pretty tired - after drinking one, I shortly then fell asleep for six hours.  Not a huge success. :)  The next day, I tried another one with slightly better success.  I've since had a few of them, both at home and at work.  I certainly haven't fallen asleep afterwards since that first day, but I don't feel particularly peppy, either.  Coffee or a Diet Coke perk me up more, even though a 20-ounce Diet Coke has only 75% of the caffeine in this.So, I admire the ingredients and don't mind the taste, but at the current price of over $2/can, I would have expected more of a result energy-wise.  From other reviews, it clearly works well for some folks, so you might want to give it a try given its positive attributes.

Don't let the name fool you.  That aside, it tastes a lot like the drink I mentioned earlier which supposedly gives you bird appendages, but it sure costs a lot.  Misleading advertising, don't really recommend.  Organic means nothing for the ingredients in this list.

If you are going to have an energy drink, this is much better than most.I have tried this while driving over a long distance, in the middle of the afternoon at work, and immediately before a light workout. It definitely does have that boost I'm looking for.With that being said, this beverage is ungodly sweet. It leaves an unpleasantly syrupy aftertaste in my mouth for hours. To those accustomed to drinking soda on a regular basis, this is probably not off-putting; but with 25g of sugar per can, it's not likely that any health-conscious person would drink this on a regular basis. Cut the sugar by at least half, and this would actually be palatable.",3.0
5606,Nice packaging but beyond that..,Yeah this isn't a real good energy drink at all.A bit sour and it leaves you with an aftertaste that you can't quite figure out.Too much sugar besides.Trying to give away the rest of my 24-pack but no takers as of yet.,2.0
5608,This energy drinks packs a whallop,"GURU Natural Energy Drink is a delicious tasting drink that will give you a super charge.  The drink is lightly carbonated and has a sweet taste to it but unlike most energy drinks, this one is not sticky sweet or overpowering.  After I quaffed the GURU I started to slowly feel its effects.  It was a slow burn that gradually worked its way.  I enjoyed the extra energy boost and it really was the lift I needed o start the day.  GURU comes in the perfect size of 8.4 ounces (not too much but just enough) and it wont go to waste.If you are looking for a natural energy drink that not only will give you an energy surge and taste great then GURU Natural Energy Drink is your ticket.",5.0
5609,We drank all 24,"I had the opportunity to try out a Guru 24 pack over the past month.  Between my wife and I we were up to the challenge and did drink all 24 over the course of the month.  Our verdict:  pretty good.  My wife actually really liked these energy drinks - she liked the taste and she liked the &#34;organic/natural&#34; aspect of it (which is something energy drinks don't usually tout).Myself personally I also liked the taste of these drinks though slightly bitter (kind of like a Red Bull) and also tastes slightly like a diet energy drink to me (though its got full calories).  However, I did find a shot of Vodka added to this energy drink creates a very nice flavor :p.  In terms of energy boost - nothing noticeable for me (though I can drink a cup of coffee then go straight to bed).Overall, this is a good effort from Guru.  We like the &#34;organic/natural&#34; slant.  Price is a bit high at $2 per for a smallish Red Bull size can.  Overall in consideration of price/value - 4 stars from me.",4.0
5611,A Very Mild Kick,"Anything that uses natural ingredients is fine in my book, so I was happy to give GURU Natural Energy Drink a try.  It includes certified organic ingredients like can syrup, white grape juice, green tea leaf extract, guarana seed extract, achinacea flower extract, and panax ginseng root extract.  That's excellent, but most energy drinks include these same ingredients (although not necessarily in their certified organic versions).What I expected was a decent little jolt of energy that was similar to the sustained energy of Five Hour Energy or the sudden punch of energy that comes with countless other energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull.What I got, however, was not much of anything except for one hundred empty calories and another can to go into the recycling bin.  I wasn't impressed at all.The slight energy that I did receive was mild and not sustained for a very long time.  I get much more out of a sugar-free, zero calorie Monster drink.The flavor was okay in my book.  I could definitely taste the grape juice, and the overall flavor was a lot less medicinal than other similar drinks.Overall, I wouldn't recommend GURU Natural Energy, unless you're a really, really dedicated organic type of person.  Also, this stuff is gluten free as well.",2.0
5615,My Husband Couldn't Get Past The Taste,"My husband is a caffeine fiend.  I avoid it like the plague, because of how my body reacts to it.  Normally, my husband likes any of the energy drinks I purchase for him.  I thought this would be a good choice since it is naturally occurring caffeine, as opposed to the artificial high.He hated the taste.  After reading the reviews of others, I told him this might be an acquired taste, and to give it another couple of tries.  No use, he still strongly dislikes it.  The price is not terrible when purchased through amazon, although I checked it out at another source too, and ouch! that price was ridiculous!  If this is for a picky person, you might want to try a can purchased elsewhere first, then place the order after the taste is okayed by your caffeine loving family member.",3.0
5616,"effectiveness varies for all - has positive potential for ""healthy"" energy boost","I am not one for energy drinks, such as Monster, Red Bull, etc., for, I cannot handle much caffeine in one drink. So&#8230;to see a product that is a &#8220;natural energy drink&#8221; with &#8220;organic ingredients,&#8221; (always a plus)&#8230;.I was ready to give this product a try. Though, I always wonder how &#8220;organic&#8221; the ingredients are, or rather, how MANY of the ingredients are organic.In any case, I was drawn in by the &#8220;natural&#8221;/&#8221;organic&#8221;&#8230;basically, the &#8220;healthy&#8221; aspects to this drink. I decided I&#8217;d give it a try, since, I don&#8217;t like heavily caffeinated beverages and would prefer an energy boost from nature/natural ingredients, or even, ingredients that aren&#8217;t manufactured and that I can pronounce.*I can&#8217;t find a can on hand, however, I remember reading the ingredients, and I could pronounce every one&#8230;except one of the berry/fruit extracts, or something&#8230;.but it was a natural ingredient, for which, I was very grateful.The drink is REALLY fizzy. I was not expecting that much carbonation &#8211; well, I wasn&#8217;t expecting ANY carbonation. So, that is the only real negative facet about this drink. Aside form this, the taste is fine. It isn&#8217;t bland (like the kind of flavour where one can barely taste it, though it claims to have &#8220;flavour,&#8221;) yet, the berry/fruit flavour is not overpowering, but it is enjoyable.Effective? Not &#34;fully&#34;/&#8221;totally.&#8221;I think it helped some &#8211; if nothing but the carbonation tended to &#8220;wake me up.&#8221; :p I mean, while I cannot handle a lot of caffeine and caffeine can sometimes affects me &#8220;opposite&#8221; (relax, not stimulate,) and while this drink doesn&#8217;t have a lot of caffeine (the green tea, where the most, if not all, of the caffeine lays, appears in the middle-ish of the ingredients list), it was more like&#8230;a kind of Russian roulette as to whether it would affect me or not&#8230;and how much it would.I appreciate how this is a natural energy drink, and I appreciate, too, that this pack can last almost a month. Granted, I only drank one can a morning &#8211; maybe some would want/need/choose multiple &#8211; but I wouldn&#8217;t suggest more than two&#8230;and even then, I&#8217;m not sure even that is the greatest/best idea. :/In any case&#8230;overall:- it&#8217;s okay- taste is fine- effectiveness&#8230;.TBD &#8211; varies from person to person, but as for me&#8230;it just didn&#8217;t make a &#8220;black and white&#8221; difference. Does it have &#8220;potential&#8221; to be &#8220;effective&#8221;? Yes. How effective? &#8230;varies.- price/cost: well, I think it is okay price, but it really is up to each to determine if it is worth it based on it&#8217;s effectiveness",3.0
5621,.,"No one consumes energy drinks because they are a delicious and refreshing beverage, they are a caffeine delivery system, and Guru isn't going to change that.  Initially, the familiar medicinal ED flavor greets the palate, though it is less aggressive than other EDs I've tried. Its mix of sugar (cane syrup), apple acid and citric acid gives it flavor not unlike SweeTarts candy.Guru contains 100 mg of caffeine (from guarana), about the same as a cup of brewed coffee and puts it in the lower third of the energy drink group as far as caffeine levels .  It didn't affect me much, but I'm a fairly heavy coffee drinker so it's not too surprising.The ingredient list here on Amazon does not match the list on the can. The can lists (in order):Sparkling water, organic cane syrup, organic white grape juice concentrate,natural flavors,apple acid, cirtic acid, organic green tea leaf extract,organic guarana seed extract,organic echinacea flower extract, organic panax ginseng root extract.  Each 8.4 oz can contains 100 calories and 25 g carbs (all sugar).Overall, a decent ED, not one I'd make a habit, but certainly less distasteful as most others I've tried.",3.0
5624,Love It!,"I have been on an organic foods diet for almost a year now and I have become much more sensitive to what I eat and drink. Out are the energy drinks loaded with sugars, caffeine, and artificial ingredients. In are the more gentler and natural energy boosters. This was  a surprise for me. I really liked it and it did give an energy boost, without any late energy crashes.The flavor is nice. A good palatable taste and feel in the mouth. No bad after taste. It sits well on the stomach, even an empty one. It provides and fairly quick ramp up in energy and alertness and lasts for several hours to all day. The ramp down in gently and hardly noticeable. I like the ingredients and the overall effect.I am finding that I need less energy boosting as my diet is becoming cleaner and healthier. However I am going to rely on these until the day when I can maintain great energy levels without supports. Or at least keeps a few in the fridge for special occasions. 5 Stars easy! Hope you get as much out of it as I have.",5.0
5626,No energy,"I consume energy drinks on a daily basis. For a few years, I drank Rockstar. For the past 2 years I have been making my own with Sodastream - I buy the diet energy because it is no calories and no sugar, but plenty of caffeine. I usually drink a full 1liter bottle first thing in the morning and I must admit I add more syrup than you're supposed to. I use about 1.5 caps of syrup instead of 1 cap. This doesn't make me race around, but just gives me the nudge I need to get on with my day. Sometimes i'll make another half liter later on in the day.This was my first time trying or even hearing of GURU, and unfortunately, I found them to be extremely ineffective. I have drank 6 of them in the past 11 hours (!!) and I took a 2 hour nap during those 11 hrs. I felt no energy at all from them. My last one of the 6 was about a half hour ago. I feel nothing, except a slight stomach ache most likely due to all of the sugar.The taste isn't bad. It has a typical energy drink taste. It has a little less carbonation than a coca cola would. I like a lot of carbonation and that is something else that I am spoiled with, with my sodastream. I can put as much carbonation as I want.I don't mind drinking them as a regular drink, but I won't be going to them specifically for energy. It definitely was not worth all of those calories and all of the sugar.The product info here on the page is a bit misleading. In one place it says 97mg of caffeine per 8.4oz  serving, another place says 100mg, but on the can it says 125mg.My sodastream claims 80mg caffeine per 8oz serving. Maybe the &#34;natural&#34; caffeine in GURU is not as potent?The sodastream syrup also has some vitamin content -  20% daily value of Vitamins B6 and B12, Niacin, Folate, Riboflavin, and Biotin, as well as 50% daily value of Vitamin C. It may not mean much, but I like having that vitamin content, as I am a picky/poor eater and I need to consume them wherever I can.The can says not to mix with alcohol and I am wondering why.I wouldn't recommend these to someone who drinks energy drinks regularly and has a tolerance for caffeine because they are ineffective.",1.0
5627,"Not very tasty, not very peppy :P","If you are out to consume only organic ingredients and do not like coffee and do not mind a ton of sugar, then this drink might be a good fit for you. I like energy drinks if they taste good and provide more energy than a cup of coffee, otherwise I pass on them.  I would pass on these.I was amazed that it had a whopping 25 grams of sugar in this tiny little can and still managed to taste pretty sub-par -- think medicinal tea flavor.  I like black tea, green tea, sweet tea and herbal tea but I do not like these. I would be interested in tasting the light version sweetened with stevia, but I did not get those kind to try. I gave 3 stars and not 1 star because I have had worse energy drinks and it is nice that the makers of GURU are using better ingredients than most do.These GURU drinks are crazy expensive for how little they are and how little energy they provided.  They just kind of made me feel like I had to drink a big glass of water and sit down, not good.  I would spend my dollars on Illy Cafe cans before I purchased these.I would rather have a shot of espresso over ice with cream for 100 calories and you can use organic coffee beans and organic cream too if you desire.  It perks me up better, tastes WONDERFUL and has only 3 things in the glass if I add a bit of stevia.",3.0
5628,Thumbs up for old-timers like me,"As a seniot citizen, I'm suffering that typical chronic old age tiredness that tempts me to sleep away more than half the day.  When I ordered this through vine, I was expecting the traditional one can usually sent out for this kind of product.  Instead, I was delighted to receive a full case of 24 cans, and I've taken advantage of that before writing my review.I'll admit that the taste didn't thrill me when I had the first can.  It wasn't awful, but it did take adjusting to and I now truly love the flavor.However, flavor isn't the important thing.  More important is that I have received bursts of energy during the 12 days of my having one can first thing in the morning and a second can during the afternoon.  Hey, I even had enough energy to have an all-nighter.  Only one, but being able to last out the wee hours is certainly unusual for me at this stage of life.This isn't a miracle working beverage.  I still have to battle chronic tiredness, but Guru does take the edge offf of it, enabling me to have more enjoyable hours of wakefulness.  I do enthusiastically recommend this.",4.0
5631,I normally don't like energy drinks...,"I'm not really a fan of Red Bull, Rockstar etc.When I drank Guru, my opinion changed of energy drinks. I haven't looked much into the ingredients of competing products, I'm your pretty standard consumer, but the fact that Guru makes it obvious what's in it (advertising the natural aspect) just gives me a piece of mind.Organic doesn't always mean good for you, and it's kinda stupid to assume unnatural ingredients = bad automatically, but it's just how I feel. I just feel better drinking Guru, knowing what's in it is something I can comprehend.ProsTastes goodDoesn't have any weird aftertaste or inspire feelings of remorseDoesn't hurt my teeth like other drinksConsNoneI know I could of made this review extremely technical/informed, but when it comes to food, I just go with my gut.",5.0

5638,Not bad if you want organic ingredients,"It was only a matter of time before the natural and organic crowd decided to have a go at the energy drink market, and here it is: Guru Energy! So how does it stack up against the competition? The answer to that depends on what you're looking for.The draw here is really for people who want organic ingredients but also still want something with kick. If you just want energy, there's much more effective options, as well as drinks that have a more pleasing taste. On the flavor front, it's not as bad as some of the more abrasive energy drinks like Monster or Rockstar, but it's also not something you'd want to just drink for the flavor on a regular basis. Despite all the fruit and natural ingredients, this definitely tastes like an energy drink and not like juice.The first ingredient is sparkling water, followed by a long list of organic syrups and fruit juices. Even with that focus on natural ingredients, there's still lots of sugar (25 grams in fact), but that's from the fruit juice, not from high fructose corn syrup like with your standard soda. There is a decent amount of caffeine present &#8211; and that's where the energy comes from &#8211; but unlike energy boost shots such as 5 Hour Energy or the average energy soda there isn't a boatload of b6 and b12 vitamins, and that's what gives you the &#8220;wake up and go&#8221; feeling rather than the jittery &#8220;I've had too much coffee&#8221; feeling.Guru isn't bad, and if you are really focused on organic ingredients it's one of the few options you have, but as far as energy drinks go it's not the best on either the flavor or the energy fronts.",3.0

I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed.  This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up.  Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice!

It tastes like every bottle of sunblock you've ever slathered on at the beach.I do like rooibos, but it does have such a mild, earthy flavor that in this tea, it's easily overwhelmed by the coconut. If you're fond of naturally sweet teas (such as mango, cranberry, etc.) you may like this well enough. But if you are more intrigued by sophisticated floral, herbal, and pure red, green and black teas, you may find this one a little bit daft.I'd also note that this does not brew a cup of Thai tea as you'd get at a restaurant. You may try this with two bags in a standard 12oz mug, but you'll be getting a mouthful of odd-tasting coconut flavor, not rooibos.Not bad at all... but clearly not the best from Yogi.",3.0

5757,GREAT tea!,"I am a big fan of Yogi tea. They make great stuff. Always very high quality ingredients, very tasty blends. This is one of the 5-star varieties. Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full-bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big ""traditional remedy"" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!",5.0

They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe, however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections.  They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process, but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections, I would highly recommend that you avoid this product.  They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection.",1.0
5791,From Good Tea (old style) to Strange Tea (this style).,"This ""newer"" Yogi product is very different from their old mix and is a big disappointment.  (To me). It's hard to describe the flavor in what I got, but there is a distinct taste of something like the odor of fresh, moist dirt.  I don't know if they got some tea from a different source, or what.  The ingredients of both are identical.  But this one is definitely unpleasant.  I make sun tea with it almost exclusively.  Their old style came in a maroon bag with a yellow square on it, and said ""Yogi Tea"" instead of just ""Yogi"".  And, silly me, I bought a bunch of this thinking I would get exactly what I like and was used to.  So, I'm sending this shipment back and going with the licorice and the ginger.  So don't buy a large quantity like I did until it meets your expectations.  My bad!",2.0

5809,Fake.,"This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified ""natural flavor"" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.",1.0
5817,"Only, Stick to the Original!","Zico - Original - This product taste was way too water down; it did not give me that `kick' I was looking for and was quite disappointed actually; as the packaging was better than the substance itself. The problem is you can't taste the coconut, then why call it `coconut water'?Chocolate - Is just okay (if you close your eyes you really can't tell the difference between the chocolate and the original; I'm just not sure what the coloring is doing to your insides); you want to make sure to shake the container well before drinking or you will have these tiny chocolate-covered pieces of coconut on the bottom which then becomes over-powering with artifical chocolate flavoring.Pineapple - NO WAY/SUCKIE!! - The problem here as well it taste too artificial, this is definitely not what you want in a product that is supposed to be all-natural.I'm now starting to come across all sorts of ads and endorsements to promote `ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural' but I think this product is way over-rated in my opinion; but all-in-all I am a advocate of drinking coconut water vs. soda or high fructose drink juices.Some of their other flavors you might want to consider (mango, passion fruit, pom-berry, strawberry banana, tropical and latte).This Review has been brought to you by 'Awakened1'.** See all my reviews:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview",3.0

I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see ""premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors.""I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?",1.0
5827,Really icky stuff. Go with the Tetra-Paks instead,"I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of ""natural flavors"", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons:ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12).These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks.",1.0

It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.",3.0
5832,Very Good-Natural and Chocolate in tetra Packs,I have tried the Natural and the Chocolate flavors in the 33.8 oz tetra packs and really like both.They have a smooth flavor and very refreshing.Thirst quenching so its great if you are doing activity such as yard work etc.I did have a couple of issues with the containers.The glue holding the cap in place on some of the chocolate flavor cartons had loosened just enough to allow a small drip thus the water ruined.I notified amazon and it was credited back to me.I did order those from the warehouse deals.I only ordered the Natural flavor once and it was also from the warehouse deals and there no issue at all with those.This was not an amazon problem but defective packaging that wasn't caught by quality control during packaging.Overall this brand is about as good as it gets for coconut water.I did buy a plastic bottle at the local grocery store and didn't really care for it.I think the tetra packs retain the flavor much better and you tend to get a slight plastic taste from the plastic bottle.,5.0

Avoid this product, Quality Assurance is a major issue. VITACOCO is better in terms of quality (VITACOCO also adds a little extra vitamin C to avoid some spoliage while shipping).

5843,Not that great,"I love coconut water. To be more specific, I love GOOD coconut water.

The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50% sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh. Goya runs a close second. I am not sure if it's the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me. Coconut water should not taste sour. Despite the rave reviews, I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya. Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first.",1.0

The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty.

5863,Not for me,"I tried VitaCoco, O.N.E. and Zico--Zico is my least favorite.  I could barely taste any coconut flavor, it was like drinking water from the tap.  In addition, on the can of Zico it's stated that the coconut water is made 'from concentrate.' None of the others are made this way.  Zico states on the can to SHAKE WELL, obviously b/c the 'concentrate' settles and needs this extra step taken.  Other brands do not. My advice is to taste test as many brands as you see fit, as some people seem to like Zico's taste.  No matter which brand you choose, there are benefits to any kind of coconut water; but to my mind and my tastebuds, I prefer the other brands.",3.0

I've gotten both the regular (Natural) and chocolate flavored Zico, and they are both great.  The natural doesn't have that sour dirty laundry water taste that others have (33.8oz).When I first tried the chocolate (14oz), I drank it pretty close to room temperature and I wasn't that impressed.  Icy cold straight from the fridge, however, the chocolate is amazing!  It is like a good for you Yoohoo (is that spelled right?) drink without all the sugar.

5905,Jessica Is Laughing All the Way to The Bank...,"I noticed Jessica Alba promoting ZICO while taking credit as a well behaved, caring parent who had many health issues when she was a child and now how proud she is being part of these fine companies including ZICO (meaning she shares the profit of the sales). Let's look at some facts on ZICO;1. INGREDIENT: all natural coconut water. Ask yourself, have you ever seen a natural food item, any food item even a coconut water when you crack a fresh coconut, where the natural water of that coconut to last for months in any temperature. No it will not last more than few hours so why is it that Jessica is not disclosing the preservatives that are included inside ZICO cartons and bottles when infact you will get no preservatives when cracking a fresh coconut and drinking the coconut juice for a dollar a coconut instead of four dollars for ZICO. With fresh coconut you will even end up with fresh coconut meat as well,,2. HYDRATE: hydration requires consuming water at zero calories, not sugar. You can drink all the coconut juices in the world and it still will not hydrate unless you drink water. Sugar will force you to drink water so you will have to consume water after drinking ZICO,3. HAND HARVEST COCONUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD: meaning not a Fair Trade certified product. Meaning ZICO is the same as Coco Cola, the same as the competition without Fair Trade certification,4. AS MUCH POTASSIUM AS A SMALL BANANA: Let' compare based on NUTRITION FACTS. For a cup comparison although not the same since we are comparing liquid with solid, but regardless ZICO vs. banana in calories 50/33, potassium 360/317, sugar 10/2.4 and tall of that not considering where banana offers 3.7mg of Phytosterols in lowering cholesterol, all other vitamins and minerals from 171% vitamin C, A, K, B6, fiber, and all minerals where ZICO offers none other than sugar in a processed container.It is fine to consume a processed food or drink if one wishes to do so but for Jessica Alba is purely misleading public while acting as a caring individual. ZICO is a processed drink in a carton, which has a whopping 40gr of sugar processed just like other coconut water brands, like Coca-Cola, not a Fair Trade product which has nothing to do with hydration or banana. I drink coconut water by cracking cold coconuts that I keep in my refrigerator and understand the nutritional value of each when a fresh coconut costs me a dollar, a banana twenty five cents not four dollars for a processed coconut in container with preservative.",1.0
5911,Very acquired taste...,"I would strongly recommend tasting one of these before order a 12-pack, as this is a very acquired taste.

5917,Popular brand but I prefer another....,"Tried Zico brand as well as Vita Coco to determine which I wanted to order in bulk for Subscribe & Save.  Zico brand had an ""okay"" taste but not near as pleasant as VitaCoco. Interestingly, Zico was cloudy and Vita Coco is quite clear.  I just researched this and read ""Coconut water is the term commonly used to describe the clear liquid found in the center of a coconut when it is still young and green."" If someone else has direct knowledge on coconuts because they grew up on them and lived where they were plentiful please share your opinion on that (clear vs. cloudy).  Either way, my choice to go with VitaCoco is purely on a preferred taste. Zico does seem to have a high rating so many do like it.  Coconut water seems to have short shelf life once opened so if you buy the large size you may want to make sure you plan to drink it within a couple of days.",3.0
5919,Absolutely Disgusting!  Sour!,"I grew up with fresh coconuts.  I also grew up with canned coconut juice (sweetened), frozen coconut juice, and recently bought some Naked coconut water from the supermarket, so I'm familiar with how coconut water should taste.It's hard to get fresh coconut where I am now so I thought I'd give Zico a try since it was the cheapest available on Amazon.  Big mistake!  I should've listened to the recent negative reviews posted here.The first pack of Zico was sour.  I took a sip and made a face.  Crap, I thought, I got a bad one.  I then opened another pack and that too was sour.  I have never tried Zico before and I hope that this isn't what it's SUPPOSED to taste like because it tastes nothing like coconut water.  If I had been blindfolded and somebody handed me this drink, I would never be able to guess it was supposed to be coconut water.  Packaged coconut water is supposed to taste similar to the juice you get in fresh coconut, right?I understand that it's not going to taste just like fresh coconuts but there should be a marked resemblance, as there was with the Naked brand I tried.  But the Zico I tried tasted NOTHING like coconut.  It MIGHT taste like the water that comes from a totally unripe coconut (never having had an unripe coconut, I can't say), or it could be the taste of coconut water gone rancid.  Whatever the reason, the taste is totally wrong and I am pissed because I've now got a 12-pack that's too disgusting to drink and isn't eligible for a refund through Amazon.UPDATE: Grocery items are not returnable, per Amazon policies (NOW they tell me).  However, I contacted Amazon to explain the situation to them and they generously offered to issue me a full refund.  Excellent customer service by Amazon--though the Zico still stinks!",1.0

Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice, I thought there would be some parallels.First of all, this drink has a strange salty flavor. Secondly, it's not sweet. It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y, but the flavors just don't coordinate with each other and don't match the smell.",2.0

5930,My favorite flavor...,"I've had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me. It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands. This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There's also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth!",5.0

If you pour a glass of this next to the other one, the difference is shocking.

5939,why so cloudy,"there is something terribly wrong with this, it is super cloudy and it makes me naseated. I had finished a store bought tetra pack of coco libre a day before this came so I know i am not allergic to coconut water- there is something off with this Zico .",1.0

5944,Return of Zico tetra pak,"I have been an avid coconut water drinker for the past year and a half and I have tried almost all the brands available:  ONE, VitaCoco, Amy and Bryan, Nature Factor, original Zico, and re-release Zico Tetra Pak, and Naked coconut water.I would like to say the original Zico was the best tasting of all of them however they changed to the plastic bottles earlier this year which received a large number of negative reviews from people who loved the original Zico thus I avoided but now have brought back the Tetra pak.This version they brought back unfortunately does not taste like the original Zico.  Some of you might think that since it's been sometime, perhaps you don't remember what the original taste like.  Well, I would say that I have purchase 12 cartons of their original Tetra pak and drink 1 or 2 a day so I definitely remember what the original taste like.  The flavor is a bit more tart and now tastes closer to VitaCoco which is the most tart of all the brands something that I just do not like.I would purchase in the following order:1.  ONE - Amazon still is out of stock and hoping they come back in stock, this is best tasting one since the original Zico is no longer made.2.  Naked Juice - I like the subtle taste and though does not have quite the coconut flavor as ONE, it doesn't taste tart which is what I don't like.3.  Zico - It just tastes more tart4.  VitaCoco - Not a fan of tart coconut water5  Amy and Bryan and Nature Factor taste way too sweet for me.Zico had the best tasting coconut and that was a consensus if you look at earlier reviews.  I would have continued to purchase their product indefinitely even though they tend to cost a bit more than the other brands but they destroyed any good will they had by stopping production of the original Zico tetra pak and  thinking consumers like us would settle for that concentrate stuff, shame on them.",3.0

These drinks have replaced soda.",4.0

5975,Loses flavor too fast,"I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Spearmint is among my least favorite flavors, beating out only peppermint. It loses its flavor within two minutes. That's not an exaggeration - you get literally two minutes of chewing pleasure. The main reason I prefer it to peppermint is that at least the spearmint goes tasteless, while the peppermint turns bitter.On the bright side, the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth two stars despite the lack of flavor.",2.0
5977,weak tasting gum,"I got this and Xilo and the Xilo definitely has a much stronger mint flavor, also bigger pieces. The Spry is cheaper, has twice as many pieces but not as much taste.",3.0

I don't know, but it's nice to know I'm actively trying to improve my health.The flavor of this gum is quite good, sweet and cinnamony with a little kick, but it lasts for all of 3 minutes. I don't even know why it says chew for at least 5 minutes on the jar if the flavor lasts for less than that.",3.0

6030,Just because it's not Orange doesn't make it healthy.,"I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they ""weren't bad"".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items.",2.0
6036,Not healthy enough to be worth eating such a vile food!,"I actually love Pirate's Booty snacks so I was over eager and purchased 2 huge cases of these.  Yikes, these are going to hard to get rid of.  A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion.  I would definitely recommend steering clear of these, and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese.  I don't know exactly how to describe these, but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and you're on the right track.  My typically non-discriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these.  These taste like something super healthy, and though they aren't bad for you, they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down.  They are worth a try as a toddler snack, but I'd order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands.",2.0

Good snack anyway with reasonably good texture that is great for those intolerant of cheese, spice, or stronger flavors. To me these would be much improved with better flavors... perhaps add a few varieties that taste better and call this one ""Corn Tings - Unflavored"" or ""Corn Tings - Original""?

As for all the health benefits, the veggies indeed impart ""flavor"" to this mish-mash, a bag of which equals 8 grams of protein plus nearly 600 calories, but what do the veggies contribute and what percentage of the product do they represent?  Unless I notice some dramatic health benefits, I'm going to have trouble disposing of 12 bags (Lesson: Even though Amazon limits you to large quantities, don't order 12 bags if you haven't first tried one).  The only way I can consume this stuff is to wash down every bite with a mouthful of cold Coke.  Or, picking up on the company's pirate theme, Coke laced with a lot of rum.

The beans didn't seem hot upon arrival either, most likely because of the storms we've been getting in the area keeping it cooler.I must also say my hands are smooth from handling all the beans from the oils.I used some of these to make vanilla extract.

6098,How is this possible?,"When two beans sell at Whole Foods for $13, I tossed aside the idea of using vanilla beans for cooking and baking.  A cooking forum I belong to linked to this listing back in 2010 and I tried it out - was amazed that it wasn't a scam, and the beans were fresh and great-smelling.When stored in a double-ziploc bag with the air pressed out, they've lasted well for over a year and a half - and I even send some home with friends occasionally when they talk about not being able to get vanilla beans.Well, two+ years later I went to re-order, and it's the same good quality and low price.  Making fresh creme brulee, muffins, or anything with these turns out great.  And you just can't overdo the vanilla (that I've found).  When I make plain creme brulee, I use about 3 1/2 beans in the recipe and get absolutely rave reviews from everyone who has tried it.What a luxury it is to have fresh vanilla beans on hand all the time!",5.0

When I opened the package (which arrived promptly) I was not blown away by a heavenly aroma of vanilla and at first was dissapointed, the beans, however, were (are) moist and plump and when I made a custard with them the flavor was rich and heavenly.  I put the beans into a couple zip lock bags and put them away, and a couple days I started smelling this amazing smell, like REALLY nice pipe tobacco, it of course was the beans (I bought a nice airtight container for them)These are fantastic and far FAR better than anything I've ever gotten from the grocery store, I will be buying these again (and again).",5.0

6123,Not my favorite but prefer over the big brand,While I appreciate that this product doesn't use artificial dyes or flavors I don't find that it has the best taste of the boxed macaronis I've tried.  My son and brother in law really like it but I find that there is an odd aftertaste.  I prefer Back to Nature's classic yellow mac and cheese variety for taste.  This is a great value when compared to buying locally and I would definitely use it over the &#34;big brand&#34; everyone knows.  My son has a sensitivity to artificial dyes and flavors so it is a must that I have a quick lunch fix available and this macaroni provides it when I don't have to eat it myself!,3.0
6124,Not the house favorite,"I have to say, after trying this and reading the reviews, I thought this would be great.  Well, it was definitely a thumbs down in this house, everyone included.  When you're asked not to buy something again, I guess that says everything.  They even thought that the local grocery store's knockoff brand was better than this.  It's just not very creamy, you have to chop up the chunks of cheese in it, and it just takes awhile to mix it in. Then, the noodles are chewy.  It's cute for Easter if you have little ones, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it.",3.0
6125,Gritty!!!!,"On the first gritty batch, I blamed user error.  I figured I had something burnt on the pot.  maybe.  Or perhaps the sauce packet hadn't dissolved all the way.  I've made mac and cheese plenty of times, but HEY, it's always possible.  For the second batch, I was extra careful.  It still turned out gritty.  The only reason this Mac and cheese got two stars instead of one is that it's edible.  If the zombie apocalypse comes, I'll still have these in the cupboard to eat.",2.0
6126,A little bit different from most.,"Anyone who loves mac-n-cheese has tried some type of brand of shells-n-cheese. The only difference is the shape of the pasta. It became a huge hit with kids because it is so cheesy.Then various companies decided to use real cheese spreads, usually with some sort of plastic or foil pouch encloused. These caught on quickly for good reason. Not only can consumers see that they are getting, in most cases, real cheese, but consumers feel that they are making the dish healther for the family.Whether that is true or not depends mainly on WHICH brand you used. The more expensive the brand does not always mean more healthy. Let us face it, many powders are just as good tasting and as healthy for your family as the squeeze. It was psychological. It worked.Then came microwave mac-n-cheese. This quickly became a busy parent's dream. However, it is not much faster than stove top. (Perhaps 4 minutes.) But when people think of microwaves, they think ""fast"". So this is currently the new craze. Not much faster and still bowls to wash. You usually get LESS pasta this way too, even though you are paying just a little bit more than normal for what you think is convenient.KRAFT advertises more than most brands, so shoppers are more apt to pick up the KRAFT brand. Think about it. How many ads do you recall seeing about ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN? Personally, I do not recall a single one. Therefore, most people totally ignore this brand.Bad move. If you check out the box, this brand is actually better for you, yes, more healthy for you, than KRAFT. Cost is about the same as well.But this comes with a little twist, ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN encloses WHITE cheddar, for a slightly different taste. Yes, there are a few other white cheddar brands out there, but again, check the box. This one really is healthier for you.So before you pick up the store generic or any other brand, you might want to take just a little time to read the package. You will find this one more impressive.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.",4.0

Best pre-prepared mac & cheese:  a tie between Amy's (VERY strong cheese flavor) and Trader Joe's ""reduced guilt"" (you can tell there's real cheese in it, though the cheese they use isn't as sharp as I'd like).  Yes, both of these are more expensive than this box mix, but if you're willing to eat this stuff you really should just buy your pasta separately and then sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top; you'll save money and at least you'll get some cheese flavor.",2.0
6158,Umm...where's the flavor?,You might as well just eat plain pasta without any cheese...you can't even taste the cheese in this stuff!  Completely & totally tasteless.  Sad.  Not even worth the time it takes to prepare.,1.0
6159,Sodium Phosphate,After years of consuming preservatives I have developed an intolerance to them. Look up Sodium Phosphate side effects. We bought Annie's because it was Organic. Who knew they would add a chemical to it? I got very sick after eating it. It really isn't Organic if it has chemicals in it.,1.0
6164,"Annie's Homegrown Classic Macaroni & Cheese, 6 -ounce (Pack of 12)","This is really good.  I have stopped buying any processed foods, and only buy organic or stuff that does not have any GMO's or bad additives. This fills the bill.  Sometimes I just like to have something that I can just make real quick, and this is really quick to make.  I can find the same thing at local store but it is more money and I have to go get it...this comes to me.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5.0
6166,Just what the doctor ordered - B-L-A-N-D,"Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it.",2.0
6177,love Annie's,"I appreciate that this is organic & it was a good deal for the multi-pack.  However, the white cheddar variety definitely has a much stronger cheese flavor than this version.  I doubt I'll be buying this again.",3.0
6179,New favorite box macaroni and cheese.,"In my opinion this is the best tasting mac&cheese; that comes in a box hand-down if you make it right. 2 tbsp butter and a about a 1/4 cup of yogurt (I just do a big scoop so that is a guess on size). If you are just using milk, then I would say Kraft mac&cheese; is better than.I do buy this stuff on amazon, but normally I buy it at the store whenever it goes on sale for Buy-one-get-one-free. I got it on amazon for ~$18 per dozen, at the grocery store I can get it for ~$15 per dozen (on sale).Do realize that even though Annie's kind of sells stuff like it is healthier for you, this is still mac&cheese.; No matter how you make it this really isn't any healthier than any other mac&cheese.; Look at the fiber count, it is not whole grains. It is certified organic if you are into that marketing trend. I buy this not expecting health food so it loses no points with me.I am however giving it four stars because the price is ~15% less and the grocery store when it goes on a good sale.",4.0
6182,Good but too salty.,"I wish they would cut the salt down. We can add our own salt. 500 mg per serving -- and these are not huge servings -- is A LOT of salt. Also, I notice that the box yields 2.5 servings. Really? Who gets the half serving?? If you split it, that's actually 625mg of salt each.",3.0
6191,Mediocre,"This is OK. I had hoped for broccoli but instead I got broccoli flavoring. All it does is give the sauce an off taste; I doubt there's much increase in nutrition. I found it on sale for 79c, not sure I'd go over $1. Not Annie's best creation!",3.0

6194,Terrible!,"This pasta was absolutely terrible. I bought two boxes and made one the other day. The smell was interesting, but the taste was awful.

6217,Teddy Graham's Competition,"I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.FLAVOR:With three flavors of ""bunnies"" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.TEXTURE:These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.OVERALL OPINIONI do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.",4.0
6223,Pretty good,"This is the first time I tried Annie's products and it was not bad.  I found the flavor a little weak even though I added a little butter with the milk.  I found when I added some of my own Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper, the flavor perked right up.  The box says 2.5 servings, but I think it's really 2.",4.0
6224,Better than the Blue Box,"This is an item I always have in the pantry. For a quick snack or side dish, nothing beats Annie's. I add a little butter as well as the milk for a creamier consistency. The flavor is far superior to the sometimes metallic tasting orange powder in conventional brands.",5.0
6225,Great boxed Mac & Cheese,This is good stuff made with real ingredients.  I really hate reading the ingredient list of Kraft Mac & Cheese.  Annie's makes quality products that taste great.  Once I starting eating Annie's Mac & Cheese I stopped eating Kraft's.  This is great comfort good.,4.0
6226,Taste like vomit,"Tastes like sick chemicals. I cannot imagine any child eating this and liking it, same goes with all of Annie's mac and cheese products. Sauce is thin, noodles are too small, and it tastes like vomit or stomach acid (I'm serious). Kraft now makes Organic mac and cheese and it's DELICIOUS, I'm eating some right now.",2.0

6231,Wanted to love this but...,"I normally love everything made by Annie's and often buy the bunny grahams and fruit snacks for my grandson. However, I was stunned by how much I hated this mac and cheese mix!! It's absolutely awful --the cheese sauce tastes artificial and leaves a weird aftertaste. Sorry Annie, but won't purchase this again. I will give it one star for being organic.",1.0
6235,Not near as good as Annie's creamy delux mac & cheese,This the only product of Annie's that I am disappointed in.

6239,"My kids love it--me, not so much","As a previous reviewer said, I found I needed to cook it at least two minutes more than recommended.  Otherwise it is not very tender and is gummy.

6241,there are better options out there,"I've bought many Annie's products, including another type of mac & cheese, so I was expecting to like this item as well.  I eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it.  With this product, I think it was more the cheese sauce than the pasta that turned me off.  I found it watery and didn't think there was enough of it, although I'm not sure if having more of something I didn't really like would be an improvement.I'll stick to other kinds of mac & cheese and skip this in the future.",2.0
6254,Organic and delicious comfort food...,"This is without a doubt one of the best ""mac and cheese"" products around.  And it is good for you too!  I noticed some negative reviews about the cheese sauce being too thin.  YOU NEED TO DRAIN THE SHELLS REALLY WELL and this will remedy that.  They are like tiny water buckets, so I stirred and shook the water out of them while they were in my collander and it did the trick.  ENJOY!",5.0
6258,Really Bad,I keep hearing about how wonderful is Annie's pasta so I tried this product. A big mistake. The sauce is extremely SALTY. I should not have purchase this product as now I have so many boxes remaining. I'll just keep the pasta and toss out the sauce packets. Stay away if you do not like your food over-salted.,1.0
6260,Tastes Like the No-Name Store Brand,"It tastes absolutely the same as any other store mac-and-cheese.  The ""totally natural"" cheese is a fine-as-talcum-powder substance in a foil packet.  Save some money and buy the store brand for 69 cents on sale at Ralph's Market.",2.0
6267,"Decent flavor, but not enough cheese","There's just not enough cheese powder in here to cover the amount of pasta in each box. Flavor is decent but there's just not enough of it, and it's very difficult to get the pasta to the right texture.",2.0
6271,Love it!  But don't love the price increase.,"My only complaint is that it could come with a *little* more cheese, and I could also do without seeing the word ""manure"" on the back of the box...that's not necessarily something I want to think about when I'm about to eat!EDIT 10/30/11: One year ago I placed multiple orders of this stuff for $12.97 per 6-pack (S&S; price).  Now they're asking $21 for it with S&S;!?  I understand there is some inflation in food prices lately, but a 62% increase??  For some dried pasta shells and a packet of cheese powder, gimme a break.  Out of control!!!  For this reason I'm knocking my 5* review down to 3* and I've placed my last order for this stuff.  It was fun while it lasted, Annie!  Pigs get slaughtered.",3.0
6272,Disapointing after all these great reviews!,"I really wanted to like these, but unfortunately, can't stand the taste of the cheese sauce.  (I don't care for Kraft either).The ingredients are better in Annies Homegrown Mac & Cheese, so if I could stand the taste, I'd eat it without question.  But the taste is, is my opinion, acidic and just bad.  Almost like another reviewer said : vomit-like.Now what will I do with the case that is left?",2.0
6273,I'm not that picky but...,"I am ALL for less chemicals and buying organic.  That being said, I don't think one should have to sacrifice taste for the sake of health.  I've tried other organic mac and cheese products and I would have to recommend that you buy one box at the store before spending on 12.  I wish I did because it has been a year now and I'm struggling to finish the pack ( I hate to waste food).  My kids don't even want it so I will not buy again.  I gave it  3 stars because it IS organic and it is edible but not ""great"".",3.0

The product maintains excellent organic integrity, and it is stored in 100% recycled paperboard packaging.The manufacturers also support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt.  The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.  There are 2.5 servings per box (2.5 oz).  Each serving contains 250 cal., 4.5 g fat, sat. 2 g fat, 10 mg cholest., 570 mg sodium, 43 g carb., 5 g fiber, 6 g sugars, 9 g protein.However, the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter, milk, or yogurt.  To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.

6280,just not for me,"I wanted to like the Whole Wheat Shells & Cheddar.  I really did.  But the sauce really is quite watery and bland, even with adding the optional butter/margarine.  Alone, cooked per instructions, my kids wouldn't eat this.  I certainly couldn't feed it to kid guests used to traditional mac-n-cheese.  But I discovered that if I mixed in some leftover spaghetti sauce it becomes quite tasty.  I use a jarred sauce added to browned ground beef.  Now that makes a very hearty and tasty meal.",3.0
6281,not worth the price,I found this product to be tasteless. Even a dollar store product has more flavor than this does. Iwould never buy this brand again and would not recomend it to anyone.,1.0
6283,Too Salty,"I had to try another box before I wrote this review because it seems hard to believe that I'm the only reviewer who didn't enjoy these.  Particularly when someone specifically said ""they're not too salty"". I'm not sure if we got an overly-salted batch, but I'm definitely not on board.My wife and I both felt they were very salty.  We were hoping to give them to our baby who's starting on biscuits now but we also want to avoid too much salt.I have a hard time telling if the strong flavor is from the salt or the cheddar.Out of the 5 people who tried it here, only my brother said ""Mmmmmm Cheddar"".  I gave him the remaining 11 boxes and hope I have better luck with the Chocolate flavored ones.",2.0

6288,Annie's Homegrown White Cheddar Bunnies,"These are god awful crackers, thay dont taste like anything close to white cheddar, they taste like a flavorless cracker.  I am upset that I wasted my money on these nasty things. I love annies products but this is not a winner in my book.  I have heard that the sour cream and onion are the best so I am going to give those a try next but word of warning, buy one box at a store first before purchasing online, you will be glad you did.  The big reason I love annies so much is everything they make is sutibale for vegetarians, meaning they use renetless free cheese so thats why I love them.",1.0
6293,don't be duped,"first of all, these little bunnies are delicious. as the saying goes, 'you can't eat just one'so why do i hate them? because its all a lie. shame. bs. there is more salt in these treats than in your back of potato chips. more salt than SALTED PRETZELS. i know because i just came from the grocery store where i checked the bags / boxes.annies with their cute little bunny and hype about 'oh gee, you can make book marks out of this box' is a load of advertising hype. the remaining ingredients/ nutrients?well, i sought out this whole wheat bunny from their assortment - and only ordered it because it DOES have some fiber - organic [good]. but the other bunnies don't - besides that, there is nothing else to merit this happy dappy pile of bunny-droppings.ps. i just opened another box and am munching away while i type. delicious.",1.0

If you have the time, make your own sauce and use Tynkyada noodles, you'll be happier and wealthier for the effort.",3.0
6299,Annie's is a staple,"I always keep Annie's Mac n Cheese on hand.  Remember, the GF pasts has to be cooked pretty close to directions...not long enough it's sticky, too long and it's mushy, but the margin of error is much less than that of regular pasta.  A GF diet isn't usually convenient and it's so nice that Annie's allows us an option for an American favorite like Man n Cheese.  I don't make it often, because it's quite high in calories, but how nice to have it around when I'm in a hurry, or just feel like having some &#34;kid&#34; food.",5.0

I'm the health food nut in the family, and I thought I would at least be able to eat it, but there's no taste at all, especially no cheese, so why bother?

6322,My Favorite Treat,"This macaroni & cheese is heavenly. Even people who are not gluten intolerant love it at our house. I add nothing to it but a bit of extra butter, and we are very happy with it. Makes being gluten-free pretty darned easy.Our only complaint (why I didn't give it five stars) is there just doesn't seem to be much here for the price. Kraft boxes are over 7 ounces (these are six) and the cost is well over double for the gluten-free. It takes several boxes to feed a family, or at least two if you have little portions...which we don't :-)",4.0
6324,Awful.,"Terrible, gritty, bland noodles that aren't anything near the consistency of wheat pasta. Under-spiced sauce with very little cheesy ""bite"". Pass on this one, and just use gluten-free cheese sauce packets on on a better pasta, such as Tinkyada's Brown Rice pasta or any other brand that actually tastes and feels like real pasta. This is a waste of money and a real let down from a company whose mac'n'cheese I really loved back when I ate gluten",2.0
6328,Awesome!,"I tried many many other boxed gluten free dinners, none of them are as good as this is to their 'gluten' orginals!The kids and I absolutely love this stuff!

6329,Wish It Had Been Good,"I generally like Annie's products and really appreciate what they are trying to do, especially in offering gluten-free items.  That being said, I tried this Mac & Cheese made with rice pasta and was seriously underwhelmed.For one thing, there weren't that many servings, especially if you are making this a main part of your meal.  Secondly, the cheese mix was very bland.  I had to doll it up with pepper and even some garlic salt before I could eat any of it.  Even then...there is no way this tastes in any way, shape, or form like regular Mac & Cheese.The rice pasta cooked up nicely, which is a plus, but I would never use the cheese mix again.  So I guess I might as well, at that point, buy my own rice pasta and mix up my own cheesy mixture to go over it.  Takes more work, but why use something convenient like Mac & Cheese in a box if you don't end up enjoying the end product?Definitely a pass.  Sadly.  If Annie's takes it back to the drawing board and makes the cheesy mix something tastier I would be willing to give it a second try.",1.0

6346,Good,"I have one child that loves it, another that is 'ok' with it. I did find a slight aftertaste to the cheese, and it does not warm up well, but the amount was just enough for the 2 kids. I would still recommend it as a great alternative to wheat noodles mac n cheese.",3.0

I usually buy the Tinkyada brand rice noodles as they are a favorite for both the gluten-loving and gluten-free crowd.  I bought this to try instead for a change through Amazon Pantry.  It's egg, nut and wheat free, which suits my son.  The noodles take longer to cook than regular noodles, but the thing I liked about these was that it didn't make a paste out of the boiling water like others do.  They cooked tender and were easy to rinse and drain.  It looks just like Kraft mac-n-cheese, which is great because my son is almost 9 and likes to eat the same as other people...which can be a struggle with allergies.  My only complaint is that is does't make much!  My son eats an entire box worth in a sitting, so if you want to make for a family..buy several boxes.",5.0

6370,"Pretty good, but not excellent. Expensive (IMO)","I thought these were pretty tasty, however at $4/box, I still think they need to do a bit of work on the pricing of this product. This said, they do taste pretty good. While the cheese sauce and noodles aren't quite up to par with a ""Velveeta Shells and Cheese"" type product, they weren't terrible either. The nice thing that I really like is these make for a nice, cheap, and easy way of making a side. I bought the ones that are reminiscent of Kraft blue box mac and cheese, and am hoping they're better (as they're a bit cheaper).Kind of going back to the ""price"" issue brought up before - my local grocery store sells Kraft and Velveeta shells and cheese for a little over $2.

I don't know what the story is with this macaroni and cheese, but it has an awful bitter taste when it is going down your throat. The taste is so bad that when I went to wash it down with ginger ale and it made the ginger taste awful too. You know when something tastes so bad that no matter how much you drink the bad taste is like pasted onto to your tongue and all liquid that comes in contact with it is morphed into a different but equally gross taste? Well, that is what was going on here. I tried eating it because I was hungry and I thought this would be a quick fix, but it was so bad that both my hunger and my grumbling stomach agreed and said, &#34;It's okay, now worries, we'll hang on until you can get some real food, but for the love of god stop eating this crap.&#34;",1.0

The ravioli was relatively firm - not all mushy - and had a nice flavor. With a little garlic powder, chives and/or basil this product really can't be beat for a quick and easy meal.  The ravioli is over $3 at my local store so buying on Amazon is really the best deal for me.",5.0

6395,"a good example of how ""organic"" does NOT always equal ""tasty""","Oy. I found these on sale at a local grocery store and decided to try them, hoping they'd be deelish and I could start ordering them from Amazon. No luck.First of all, I should have known they'd be a bit. . .well, bland. The tomato  ""sauce"" is a product of water and tomato paste, which I normally wouldn't consider worth much. The sauce is a very light red color (more orange than red, really), very thin (by my standards, anyway), and an oddly bland sweet flavor that really did not light my fire. Of course, nothing canned ever stands up to the ""real"" thing, but this is, to me, beyond the norm when it comes to blandness.The ravioli themselves are very mushy and tend to separate as soon as I touch them with my fork. The bottom layer comes off, the cheese inside begins to mix with the sauce, and soon I have pasta squares instead of ravioli. A cheesy blandness rather than the original tomatoey blandness. Yuck.They aren't the worst I've ever had, but I was hoping I would like them more than the usual crap out there, like the Chef Boyardee ravioli (which actually taste good in comparison to these--yowsa!).I give this product a three because of the ingredients being organic, but man--spice it up a little, Annie's! Or at least, add some tomato chunks in there, or maybe use pasta that won't separate when you barely touch it.",3.0
6401,Awful,I had to look down to make sure I wasn't eating the box the shipment came in.  The sauce has no flavor; there is no cheese taste.  Serving suggestion:  clothes pin on the nose and a few drips of Tobasco.  Or eat it when you have a cold--and blame the lack of flavor on your health.,1.0
6403,"Quick, healthier meal for kids","This soup is basically an organic version of Spaghetti-o's. My kids like the soup. It doesn't have a large amount of solid nutrients, but it tastes good and the kids like it. I keep a couple cans on hand for when we need a quick dinner. I gave it three stars because when it arrived most of the cans were dented. Also, the price increased substantially recently.",3.0
6404,Not all that tastey,"Very bland tasting. Since, I ordered a 12 pack without trying one out first, I now have to dress it up to eat it. It has very little sauce so I usually add marinara sauce, salsa or as a last resort ketchup in order to tolerate it.",2.0
6405,Kid-Friendly But ...,"This is definitely a kid-friendly, super-easy (open and heat) product. Easy to serve and usually welcomed with excitement by the under-7 set based on looks alone. BUT if you think these are a super-healthy option just because they are organic, you're definitely kidding yourself. Organic or not, this is still stuffed with sodium and preservatives, albeit of the more natural variety--it is, after all, canned, pre-cooked food. Better than a trip through the McDonald's drive thru? I'd say, yeah, probably, especially with a vegetable side. Healthier than just about any other non-prepackaged pasta option, organic or otherwise? Umm, not likely.As for taste, the reviewer who called these pasta in tomato soup just about nailed the flavor profile, though the mushy pasta wasn't pointed out (perhaps implied?). Honestly, in the one time we tried these, when my four-year-old was left with a babysitter that I don't really want to ask to cook anything, he was excited at first, but then barely ate any.In general, I think Annie's tends to make tasty, convenient products that are a healthier (note I didn't say ""healthy"") choice than similar products, but this one seems like a miss. If you must have processed convenience food on hand--and, c'mon, I do my best, but we're all human, and busy--I think there are plenty of tastier and more nutritious options out there, including other Annie's Organics products.",2.0

6420,Good but not great,"These are ok, but the Annie's elbows & 4 cheese is much better.  In my opinion shells are not as good for macaroni and cheese.  Elbows have a better texture and they trap cheese inside the elbow tubes.  These shells are also too small, and the cheese in the pouch is not as tasty as Annie's 4 cheese sauce.  Get the Deluxe 4 cheese instead, it's much better.",3.0

6429,Was there something wrong with my package?,"I was really looking forward to microwavable mac & cheese, but this tasted so bitter and horrible. I checked the date to use by, and it was far in the future. I tried another packet on another day in case it was a fluke, but the same vile taste was present. I discarded the rest of the box. My guess is that something was wrong with the whole package, and it's probably not common, but just in case, I will not be ordering this again.",1.0
6432,One of my travel essentials,"For constant work travel, one of my packed meals consists of this Annie's mac n cheese, a tuna packet, and some kale chip crumbs.  I microwave the macaroni, stir in the cheese powder, tuna and veggies, and it is usually warm enough to heat through.  It is a good meal size for me, lightweight, and simple to prepare. These are also good for storing in a desk drawer for ""I forgot my lunch on the counter at home"" days. I've never eaten Kraft EasyMac and can't imagine doing so-I enjoy Annie's.",4.0
6436,Yuck,"I give this product two stars because there are no artificial ingredients and it is 75% organic.

I saw this for about $5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version (which is far from ""all natural"") I bought it.Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes. I did not time it, but it was more than two minutes. My son would not eat it. I made myself a package. It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.This product was a big fail in my household.This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like. Before trying this stuff, I was 100% satisfied with Annie's products.",2.0

I would advise adding a little bit more water to the macaroni as it came out of the microwave too dry.  Also, if you really like to add extra salt to your food, you'll probably like this because it has a very salty taste.",1.0

6453,Hated it ...,"Just hated this mac and cheese. So artificial, yuck and made me sick in the stomach. I bought a whole lot and could not eat more than two packs.

6462,"I'm torn because these SHOULD be so good,","but they aren't. Not really. Oh, the ingredients are good. I like the use of organic wheat flour, and I generally trust the Annie's brand name. But there's little else about these little crackers to rave about. Why? Because they are almost flavorless. I'm not someone who uses much salt.  You won't catch me even touching the salt shaker during a meal, and I probably go through less than 2 ounces of the stuff in an average year of cooking at my house. But I found myself wanting to pull out a salt shaker and sprinkle some of the stuff in the bag, then shaking it so the crackers might at least have a chance of acquiring some taste. I don't know if I got a bad case of these or what (certainly all the other posted raves make me wonder), but I won't be buying them again.",3.0

6490,Not that great!,"Quite frankly, we think this soup is disgusting.  There is no flavor to it whatsoever, and if I accidentally buy it, hoping a different flavor will be better, my husband (who eats ANYTHING!) just groans and chokes it down.  The only thing good about it is that it does have more ""stuff"" in it to fill you up, but just no taste.  After you dump about a pound of salt into them, they resemble something with some flavor, but not really.  It's healthy all right, but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well.  If you don't like spices, then this is your soup.  However, since I make my own and we're more used to flavor, this one just doesn't cut the broth.",1.0

6510,My favorite,"I have tried several of the Stash herbal teas (and other brands), and this is my favorite.  As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, it is a little weak when compared to other brands, but the flavor makes up for that, in my opinion, and I do not always want a strong tea.",4.0
6511,"Weak, as usual for this brand","I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand.  When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.",2.0

6550,Stash tea can vary from batch to batch,"I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  This Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  Of course, I added milk and honey.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.",2.0

6577,It's Great When It's Good,"rating system: 3 is a compromise.  It is a 5 when it they company gets the formula right... a 1 when they don't.It seems Stash Stashed the secret recipe in too secret a spot and sometimes they forget where it is.  It's Great when they get the formula right--in fact, it's the best Earl Grey in the world--WHEN all the planets come into allignment.  I just received a dozen or so boxes and 2 of them are entirely devoid of any Bergamot at all... plain tea--and WEAK tea at that.  The factory clearly has quality control issues.  Very disappointing...  Just the smell of a cup of Stash Earl Grey is uplifting--WHEN they make it correctly at the factory... sadly, I have not had a good cup in several weeks... (and I drink several cups a day)... playing Earl Grey Roulette is sad.  Hope the next box was made by the ""first string"" employees and hope they brought their ""A"" game.",3.0
6587,Not like chai at all!!,"I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this!",1.0

6589,Vicks Vapor Rub,"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one.",1.0
6590,"still practicing, can not return.","the smell of spices from this tea is awesome, but the tea itself is weak, if you try to let it soak in the cup for extra seconds it will leave bitter taste,I tried to  add a packet of lipton tea but the taste still bitter, soI'm still practicing with it, it also didn't work with half&half;, not much with coffee mate. nothing like the original or made from scratch.MY RECOMMENDATIONS: since it is huge quantity that you can't return, try one package from the store first and see if it works for you.",3.0
6591,NOT organic,"I bought this because I thought it actually had organic ingredients- as the description stated.  It does not.  It's quite good Chai tea, but I'd rather drink organic Allegro chai tea (available at Whole Foods for close to this price) than buy this stuff.  The good news is that unlike some teas on Amazon, this one is very fresh and has a good sell-by date.  I ordered it only a few weeks ago, and it is good until 11/2012.  So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.  I really like Allegro chai- it tastes more balanced to me, and I was hoping the Stash would be like that, but it's not.",1.0
6593,Excellent,"This tea is very hearty...definitely ""double"" in spicy, chai flavor!  I recommend it to anyone who likes a stronger tea. And you can't beat the deal especially with the Prime program -- save a couple of dollars + free shipping!  Add a little sweetner and cream and it really enhances the flavors!",5.0
6601,Not a fan,"Not familiar with what ""chai"" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.",2.0
6606,Too oily,"I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good. It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again.",2.0
6612,Good tea blend. Not 'the best there is' but it's more than decent,"The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.",5.0
6614,"Still a cinnamon tea, but not as overpowering as in Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea","This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more.",3.0
6616,Yummy!,"I really enjoyed this tea and will definitely order again.  The jasmine is subtle and more of a scent than a flavor to me, but it's still wonderful.",5.0
6618,Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor,"I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!",5.0
6620,On second thought...,"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~",3.0
6624,"OK Tea, not bad",I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas.,3.0
6628,Stash fan but think Chai is best done with black tea,"I have loved Stash since they started. I used to have friends from Pacific NW send it to me. I think there are many more outstanding tea companies now so it is no longer the treat that it once was 20 yrs ago when all we had was Lipton or Bigelow. I like my Chai hot, richly spiced, fragrant, sweet and milky smooth as it is intended. My favorite OTC chai is Oregon Chai liquid but it's not portable and the powdered version is not as yummy and at twice the sugar content doesn't have the same delicious sweetness of the liquid.I decided to go healthy and try this green version. I am not sure that green tea can stand up to intense Chai spices. If steeped too long/hot the green tea gets bitter but if not long enough full flavor of the spices  don't develop. It's not workable and won't satisfy a die-hard Chai lover. But if you want a milder green tea version and have not learned to love the real deal, this might be worth a try. .",3.0
6629,"The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.","The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).",3.0
6632,Rooibos and nothing more,"Red&White tastes exactly like plain rooibos, which was slightly disappointing since I was expecting something more exotic, thanks to the tea's name. Nonetheless, it's a decent rooibos tea with strong flavor.",3.0
6635,MOROCCAN MINT - some other reviews are for different flavors,"I spent a long time looking for spearming teas on Amazon. This package had just what I wanted, ""Exotic blend of green tea and mints, with a hint of lemon"". The ""Ingredients: A blend of spearmint, green tea, lemongrass and peppermint."" These are all favorites and I could hardly wait for my first taste. I was really disappointed. The tea tastes very weak. I increased the amount of tea recommended by doubling then tripling the amount in ratio to the water suggested. I tried varying my water temperature and amount of time boiling. I am still disappointed. Although tripling the amount made for a stronger taste, I still don't notice the lemongrass and vaguely taste the peppermint. I started adding a tea bag of ""Traditional Medicinal Spearmint"" to my batch and that improved the flavor dramatically.Tea has always been in my ""blood"". Growing up, I seldom drank soda or Kool Aid. I rarely drink coffee or alcohol; tea is my beverage of choice.I will try another flavor from the Stash family but this was a big disappointment.",3.0
6646,Mint?,"This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor.",3.0
6653,Not bad.,"I actually like this tea, but I did give it three stars for a couple of reasons. The tea, in my opinion, is average... nothing really to set it apart... three stars is average... The tea is not organic, no really high points, no really bad points... again... average. The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.",3.0
6655,Unpleasant Grassy Taste,"I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp ""bite"" I normally expect from a good green tea.I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.",1.0
6658,Pure and Not Bitter,Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.~The Rebecca Review,5.0

However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.",3.0

I don't know why this is, but it bothers me enough to tell others about it.",3.0

6679,Expected it to taste better because I love Stash,Not sure why this Stash Choco Hazlenut tasted so different then when I have purchased it in the past. I was really disappointed in the amount of tea leaves in each bag. Just wasn't the same Stash I've purchased in the stores. It almost seemed like it was old or stale. Really bummed to because I was looking on buying this over and over again from this vendor.,2.0
6681,just awful,Their Earl Grey and English breakfast do not come close to the quality of Twining teas.Very disappointing. Poor quality. Lousy flavor.,1.0
6682,I've had better,"I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural ""flavors"". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.",3.0
6683,SOY,This is the only herbal or decaf tea I have ever had that has soy. I am alergic to soy and am now stuck with 5 boxes of tea I can't use.,1.0
6690,Read Stash Labels carefully.,"I bought this from my local market.  My husband liked it.  I happened to notice this morning when looking at the tea bag wrapper, it containted PEANUTS!  No mention of that allergen was listed on the outside of the box.  I fired off an email to Stash already.  It seems Amazon got it listed correctly.  All of my tea has now been trashed.Watch out since Stash does not seem to label the outside of their boxes.",1.0
6692,Has an artificial chocolate smell and taste,"First I wish Amazon would separate the reviews for Stash teas based on flavors rather than lumping them all together.  I have the Stash Chocolate Mint Oolong tea and I really like that, so I figured I would also try this so I could have a decaf chocolate tea as well.  I ended up giving the rest of this away because the artificial smell and taste got to me. Normally I love hazelnut and figured chocolate hazelnut would be even better.  I suggest when you read the reviews on here that you check to see which flavor tea is being reviewed so that you aren't mislead.",1.0
6695,Love the Flavor,"Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.",5.0

6699,Non-Tea Drinkers will Like it Too,"I have to be honest, after reading the other reviews I was expecting way more flavor in this tea. I was also expecting a thicker texture, which it doesn't have.Though I really like chai tea, I haven't had it in maybe 15 years and couldn't remember much of the taste anymore. However, it's still a great tasting tea. Even non-tea drinkers will like the light, smooth vanilla taste of this dessert flavor-like tea. I decided to get it in decaf, because I will be drinking it a few times a day. Great alternative to pop and other similar drinks. I suggest giving it a try.",4.0
6700,Chai Spice Decaf,"I have both kinds of Stash Chai tea - regular and the decaf version.

I think the decaf version is much weaker.",3.0

A decent, very decent actually, decaf earl grey. Smile.",5.0
6707,"Tastes OK, but with a slight issue","It tastes mildly of chocolate with the addition of stevia in it.  The problem though is the dental hygienist pointed out at my last cleaning that my teeth are getting unusually stained from something new I'm eating or drinking.  I mentioned purchasing a ton of this tea from Amazon and she was pretty sure that was the source since I don't normally have this issue.  As a result, I've mostly quit drinking it.",2.0
6709,"Not my ""cup of tea"" :)","This tea just isn't for me--I thought it was a little gross. It didn't seem to taste like chocolate OR hazelnuts.I don't really think it had much taste at all, really.  Pretty disappointing. I didn't add any sugar to it, so perhaps the flavor would change a little with some sweetness?",2.0
6711,Not impressed by this tea,"I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommendChocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still,Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Teahas a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include:Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea,SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2), andBigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6).  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.",2.0
6712,Not bad for a decaf green,"As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh ""green"" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.",2.0
6713,Chemicals in a bag!,I honestly don't know how this item is allowed on store shelves! It's THAT BAD!I was having trouble locating my favorite vanilla nut tea from another tea company and in its absence decided to try Stash's. I cannot even express how 'chemical' and unnatural it smelled and tasted! I had to throw it out! Will never purchase Stash again.Disregard the 1 star rating... I would give it 'zero' if I could!,1.0
6723,Like Slim Jim flavored paper,"Had a craving out of the blue.  Felt & tasted like I was chewing Slim Jim flavored paper.  Even after I peeled the casing, it chewed down to what seemed like a wad of paper.  I don't remember this happening in the long ago past.",1.0
6727,A Tougher Texture,"My niece and I are huge fans of Slim Jims and I love the smoked taste that they have. These are the Slim Jim Giants, so they are a much longer than the other one the meat is still smokey, but the casing on these sticks are thick and I even pulled it off but the casing was still a little tough. The meat is good and the flavoring is as good as I remember but the casing is too tough and I wish they would bring back the old formula.Great tasting inside a not so great tasting outside.",3.0
6733,Okay,A good snack but became sick of it. The sticks are about 3 inches in length. A pack of 100 seems like a lot for a fair price.,3.0
6734,Great for kids or on the go,"I used to be a huge Slim Jim fan. Ok, that is meant both literally and figuratively. I have lost 225 lbs since those days! But back then a Slim Jim was a part of my daily routine.Fast forward 10 years. I hadn't eaten a Slim Jim in forever, my poor kids didn't even know what they were! I couldn't let that last.So we got the pack of 25 Giant Smoked Snacks.I think my son puts it best: ""It is a bacony, beefy, smoky stick of yumminess!""I would tend to agree, but for me they are now too greasy. My son, of course, doesn't mind the grease,""It's like a beefy stick of bacon! Who cares if it is greasy?""So Slim Jim products are now back in our lives. But they will be a rare snack food, not a daily ""must have"". Everything in moderation.Overall: 3 stars. Beefy bacon goodness, if only we could get rid of the grease.",3.0
6737,"Weird taste, weird texture.","I used to like Slim Jims way back in the day, so I was glad to get these from Amazon. But I'm very disappointed. I'm not sure if this is how they're supposed to taste, but they're very strange and unpleasant.I noticed that these don't say they contain pork, but they do contain ""mechanically separated chicken."" They also contain textured soy protein and corn syrup. Gluten-sensitive people should be aware these contain wheat flour. Since the packaging doesn't advertise that they are anything but a ""smoked snack stick,"" and that description only occurs in fine print above the ingredient list, I'm going to guess these aren't aimed for people who care about niceties like ""meat-looking snacks actually being composed of meat."" At 140 calories, 3 carbs, and 480mg of sodium per stick, they aren't too bad in my opinion for the size of snack you get in the package. And on the plus side, they are quite filling.But that's about the only good quality these things have. Their casings are fibrous and almost papery, and toward the bottom the sticks are coated in a strange slick reddish oily liquid. The stuff inside the casing is an odd texture and even more odd scent--dry and oily and redolent of smoke flavoring and spices. They taste dry and powdery and yet soaked in oil and binders. They knock you off your butt with cloying smokiness, and there are weird bits of gristle all through it--some chunks so big I couldn't eat them. Every bite chewed down to a cardboard-y feel. The flavor lingered in my mouth long after eating the stick and my husband, a vegetarian who normally doesn't mind at all if I cook or eat meat around him, said he was overwhelmed with the stench of the stuff on my breath even after I brushed my teeth and flossed (which was actually a necessity as the sticks' fibrous contents had gotten stuck in my teeth).I cannot imagine anybody wanting to purchase these and cannot imagine them as a valid snack food. The only way I could eat them is if I were starving hungry and/or drunk. I can actually see these going well with cheap beer. But otherwise, I'm certainly never buying any.I don't think they were anywhere near this bad in my youth. I can't even imagine what happened to Slim Jims in the last 20 years, but I'm sorry to see a cherished snack from my childhood destroyed this way.",1.0
6754,just ok,"Slim Jim; this smoke snack is okay, but I did not care for it however my husband kind of liked it. We both thought that it was greasy in the mouth and left an unpleasant aftertaste. It had a bad way of digesting causing indigestion which means have your Tums or Rolaids close by. My husband is always chewing on but I can't eat them. So it's a 50-50 on purchasing this product. If you like this kind of thing then you'll be fine but I'm not going to purchase them.I hope this helps in your decision on whether to purchase or not to purchase.",3.0
6755,Not the same as previous order,"I am on the subscription service for the Slim Jim pack of 100.  My most current order does not contain the same product.  The box I received a few days ago has PORK in it, which is NOT mentioned in the product description.

6760,Greasy and chewy,"This is a traditional and long marketed snack food. The nutrition is nil of course, and high in fat and salt. The 'skin' is tough and wrinkled, making it is a little chewy. A larger diameter would be nice, but then that snack already exists such as Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage. The smoked flavor is strong and good for my taste. The high fat content does make it greasy. Leaves an oily feeling in my mouth. They will make you thirsty. I will buy them once in a while as opposed to chips or other readily available snacks with no protein content. Can keep a few in the glove conpartment since they don't need refrigerating.",3.0

6772,Taste as good as I remember,"I hadn't had a Slim Jim since I was a kid in high school so when I recently had one I was happy to see that it tastes just like I remember it. When you first bite into a Slim Jim you get that snap from the casing and then you get a butst of spicy, greasy, meaty goodness. Yes I said greasy. Slim Jim are greasy but in a good way and once you try one, you will understand what I am talking about.",4.0
6778,"Not good. I tried to like them, but couldn't...","I've consumed products of this nature most of my life, but these just fell far short of being any good. To put it bluntly, they're just too greasy and chewy. There are many products of this nature in the same price range that are of far higher quality, so there's really no excuse for making something this poorly.Right out of the bag, they were very greasy to the touch, and left an orange grease on my fingers. The casing and filling seem like wet paper with seasoning, and the filling appeared to be the cheapest ""meat"" you could pull from an animal and still call it meat. I've eaten beef sticks in this same price range that are clearly beef, with much better texture and consistency.These sticks also contain mechanically-separated chicken, which is a pretty disgusting product I try to avoid. Watch some being made sometime, and you'll never eat it again.If you like greasy, spicy meat-stuff in a chewy, paper-like casing, you'll like these. If you would like a bit of quality and texture in a beef stick, look elsewhere. If I had to describe these with one word, it would be 'nasty.'",1.0
6779,"First batch was great, second batch was stale and old","this is the second time I have ordered these from the same seller (Amazon as it gives free shipping). The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all. For those who like slim jims you know what I mean about them being plump and oily as opposed to hard and dried out without much oil.This is the ONLY place I can get the HOT ones so I was dissappointed with the second batch, while the first batch was perfect! I will continue to buy these but may see baout buying from a different seller to get fresher ones.",3.0
6781,Chomping on Slim Jim,"Considering the ingredients list on the Slim Jim they are not the healthiest of snacks. My husband likes them tho. He is a golfer and finds they are handy to toss in his bag for a day on the course. These sticks are longer than the norm and 140 calories each. They have a chewy, texture that gives you more to chomp on than say the quick swallow of candy. Overall, considering what is in them they are not for me.",3.0
6783,"Low carb, spicy snack sticks","I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.These aren't the ""spicy"" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.  Free shipping with Amazon's Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal.  And if you sign up for automatic delivery (no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment) you will save an additional 15%, making each stick about 20 cents apiece.",4.0

6798,Meh...,"I try to eat nutritiously, but I believe in moderation, so I will occasionally have a snack that is less than healthful if it has a taste I find appealing. I'm partial to beef jerky, certain types of chips and Snickers bars. Just not too often.These Slim Jims will not be joining my short-list. They are, I guess, sausages of a sort--foot long tubes about a 3/8 of an inch in diameter. The outer skin is taut and crispy. The inside is soft and somewhat mushy.They are made with beef and chicken, but there is no discernible meat flavor--just spice heat. I guess they would be a good accompaniment to a beer or two, but I can think of other things (salsa and corn chips, flavored pretzels, etc.) that I'd rather have with that beverage.Nutrition on these is hair-raising, even for a guilty pleasure. A less than one ounce snack which will deliver 140 calories, 23% of your daily allotment of saturated fat and 20% of your sodium, not to mention some nitrite--that's pretty hard-core.Sorry, Jim.

I'm not sure exactly what has changed but the giant Slim Jim seems to be much more slim than the regular size ones thus maybe making the wrapper more overpowering. Not to the point that we didn't want to eat it, but enough that we will not be buying these particular Slim Jims. Maybe if you went with the flavored variety instead of the regular smoked flavor it would taste better? Price-wise, it's not a bad value.

Its not only solid at room temperature, butwhen I heated one of the bags partially up to try to clean the oil off the kernels so I could pop them with some regular oil.. I couldn't even get the blasted stuffoff of the bowl I had it in, with warm soap and water....So I looked this frankenoil up, it's 85 percent saturated fat, why the Newsmans Own company would choose this hard solidified oil instead of some regular oil is beyond me.. maybethe organic version of corn oil is too expensive... maybe theyre trying to keep it from leaking during storage by having this solid mass.. I dont know..But don't waste your money, if you have any palate at all you wont like this, the mouth feel is tacky and waxy plus an unpleasant taste to the palm oil, which like others said solidifies onthe popcorn and gives this granularish greasy waxy feel. Not good at all.  If youre the type that cant tell the difference between margarine and butter or real whipped cream and cool whip..you might not mind this stuff. But for something this saturated, may as well use real butter.Im stuck with about 8 more boxes I'm having to heat and get the oil off the kernels.. what a blast.",1.0

But not without a price.  :-(  I reviewed the label and even though it advertises itself as ""no butter"", the popcorn still uses plenty of other oils.  Like palm oil which is an all-natural ingredient, but also one of nature's fattiest substances.  It's not as unhealthy as butter, but it's still pretty bad (especially if you're like me and eat 5 servings (the whole bag) in just one sitting).Alternatives:- Orville Redenbacher's ""Light Natural"" is a better alternative, offering a pleasant taste but with just half as many calories, half the fat, and approximately the same amount of sodium.- Bearito's No Salt/No Oil and Healthy Choice Popcorn are other alternatives, although I don't think they taste as good as Redenbacher's ""Light Natural"" brand.

6947,"Has a decent taste and it does its job, but there are better bars out there","The thinkThin bar is not a snack bar, but is intended to replace a meal.

The bar itself contains 240 calories (70 from fat), and has 24 grams of carbohydrates and 20 grams of protein.The taste on the fudge thinkThin was OK, but not great. Also, the price per bar is a bit high. On the other hand, though, it was somewhat filling, and did do a good job of replacing my lunch - keeping me going though the afternoon.It's not a bad bar, having a decent taste and it does its job, but there are better bars out there.(Review of thinkThin Chocolate Fudge, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Bars)",3.0

6949,"240 Calories and 8 grams of fat per bar, not for calorie counters","I recently spent several months counting calories and monitoring everything I ate in an effort to lose some weight. Never in my life had I ever paid much attention to the actual calorie numbers in foods. I just looked at grams of fat. In the 90's that's what we were all told to do, watch fat grams. Of course now we know better. Calories do indeed matter. I spent a few months using the calorie deficit method (taking in less calories than I was burning daily) and lost about 30 lbs total. I found this worked better for me than going to the gym, since spending every day running on a treadmill just made me eat more! I've been back to eating normal for a few months now, and so far have maintained the weight loss. But I haven't forgotten what I learned during the time I was dieting, and now I check out exactly just how many calories are in the foods I'm eating.Just because something says ""thin"" on the label doesn't mean it's necessarily going to help you reach that goal. After trying this bar, I also read up on the calorie and fat numbers. Each one of these chocolate fudge bars has 240 calories and 8 grams of fat. To give you a comparison, a full size Butterfinger bar has 270 calories and 11 grams of fat. There are actually MORE calories in one of these chocolate fudge bars than in a large Butterfinger bar you can pick up at any gas station in the candy section. What these do have is a bunch of protein. So if you're just doing some basic dieting by cutting calories and trying to shed some pounds, this bar is not going to help you meet any calorie goals. If you're doing intense cardio workouts and need some protein to keep up your stamina, then these are for you. They obviously have some benefit over the empty calories of a candy bar. But for many of the popular diet programs that require you to watch calorie numbers, these bars have the same numbers as a typical candy bar.As for taste, this chocolate fudge is okay. People who only like real chocolate and dislike anything that isn't the real thing, will probably not find the taste all that appealing. For others who are more accepting to the taste of ""diet foods"", the taste/flavor is okay.For those people who prefer the taste of real chocolate, but are looking for something more healthy than candy bars, I'd suggest checking out the KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars. They have very similar calorie/fat/protein numbers as these thinkThin bars, but use real chocolate that can be loved by even the pickiest candy lovers.",3.0

6954,Definitely Not For Me or My Spouse,"I was under the impression I was getting a box of 15 bars at least there was nothing otherwise that would indicate something less. I received one bar on a hot Saturday afternoon delivered by the Post office. The bar was soft and we had to refrigerate it for several minutes before we could taste it. The first taste was enough to appreciate the fact we only received one bar of the Think This Chocolate Fudge Bar. There is a slightly bitter taste plus there is a lingering dryness that will take a while to disappear. While the bar touts only 20g of protein and zero sugar, I think we will opt for a High Protein Bar that has more flavor and less of the after lingering effects. I just ate a Hershey bar and now the original taste is gone. By doing so I messed up terribly the sugar and protein count for today.The bar states that the mission of thinkThin is to positivity impact the lives and wellness of others and to lead in changing the endemic destruction of weight and poor nutrition related diseases in our country. I am afraid the maker has gotten somewhat carried away in his/her ambitious mission statement. I may never buy a protein bar again. Sorry! I do agree that you would probably lose weight since after the first bite I wanted nothing else to eat.By the way the bar does not hold up to the very hot heat outside here in Texas however In have to fault the Post office for part of this since the delivery was made in the late afternoon thus that little bar has been on that truck all day.",1.0

Makes me feel full without making me tired from excess carbs. Zero sugar in these; good job.Incidentally, I have had several types of the Think Thin bars, and I think this one tastes the best.  Not bad for a protein bar, and even better with a big cup of coffee.  Wish the chocolate flavor was a little stronger, but not a deal breaker.  I just bought another box.",4.0

I'll leave that to individual tastes in case you buy it.",2.0
6970,Meh ....,"These are OK.  Not the best kind of protein (soy is inadequate to whey or other types) and not a whole bunch of it.

6971,No Real Flavor...Expensive,"These Thin bars are unfortunately pretty much what you would expect from something like this.  Small, flavorless for the most part, or at least carrying an off flavor, and only satisfying in the sense that you know its better for you than a Twinkie.  I really didn't get any real chocolate fudge flavor out of these at all.  They really don't taste bad, just not satisfying or all that pleasant.  They do the trick as far as having something in your tummy and putting off hunger pangs for a little while, but that's about it.  One thing I did like about them is the chewy texture.  It was rather gummy to me in that sense which is something you either like in these things or not. I do for it gives you the sense of this small bar lasting a little longer...My biggest gripe with these is the cost.  None of these protein/diet type bars are cheap, but these are definitely on the high end for sure. And there is no flavor there to account for the bigger bucks. You can do better here as far as taste, and price.  The specs on these are pretty good for those that are really trying to lose weight or snack healthier, but I see no reason to recommend them otherwise...",2.0

I did like the consistency of it.  Smooth.  Overall, it was a better tasting chocolate than most of the chocolate protein bars I've tried.",3.0
6975,Yuck,"The only word appropriate for describing this product is gross. I eat a lot of protein bars, my favorite being Quest bars. I tend to steer clear of protein bars that have that artificial/chemical flavor and unfortunately these fall into that category for me. Some flavors are better than others and although this was one of the less offensive flavors (hence the two stars), it's still not a product I'd ever buy again.These have that typical ""protein bar"" texture that's a bit difficult to explain... it's somewhat dry and crumbly and almost seems to dissolve in your mouth as you chew, and the flavor was sickeningly sweet in a very artificial way. Everything about this bar just tasted so unnatural and I've come to expect more from protein products at this price point.Overall I found this bar to be awful and cannot recommend this product.",2.0
6977,Bland,"The thinkThin Chocolate Fudge Bars don't offer much to stand out in the aisles of Snack/Meal Replacement bars found at the market these days.

6978,Think Thin Chocolate Fudge Bar,"This review is for the Chocolate Fudge flavor of the Think Thin Bars.  In a word, yuck.  This bar may be all kinds of nutritious, but you have to want to eat it for that to take any effect.The taste and texture was kind of like eating cocoa powder dusted Styrofoam.  It was kind of chewy and soft all at the same time and the only flavor, aside from a dry flat taste, was the cocoa powder.  And it was more like a milk chocolate for the cocoa powder as it had that kind of sour aftertaste.  Needless to say, I didn't enjoy it.The ingredients are decent.  The following is the ingredients list copied from Think Thin's website:PROTEIN BLEND (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, CALCIUM CASEINATE, CASEIN) GLYCERIN, MALTITOL, COATING (MALTITOL, COCOA BUTTER, CHOCOLATE, SODIUM CASEINATE, MILK FAT, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SALT), ALMONDS, WATER, CANOLA OIL, CHOCOLATE, ALKALIZED COCOA, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SEA SALT.You would think since it was real chocolate and cocoa butter that it would have been a bit better tasting, but all I can think is that perhaps they used low grade chocolate.  And I was really surprised to see almonds listed in there, I didn't taste them at all.  And using Maltitol for the sweetener, I would have preferred stevia or even just a tiny bit of cane sugar (yes I realize part of this products boast is having 0 grams of sugar, but a tiny bit wouldn't hurt).  Still, for a protein bar this isn't a bad list in comparison to other brands.This product is certified to be gluten free and it is sugar free unlike many bars out there.  So it is unique in that aspect and good for those on special diets.  There's 240 calories per bar, but this is meant to be a meal replacement or training snack, not a regular snack.  8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber are in it along with 20 grams of protein, which is a lot.  And while there is no sugar, sugar alcohol is present as 12 grams of this bar.I wouldn't buy these again.  At least not in this flavor.  Perhaps some of the others are a little better tasting.  But I couldn't even finish this bar I thought it tasted so bad, and I'm not normally one to waste food.  But, perhaps with different taste buds, someone could enjoy this enough to reap its nutritional benefits.Review by M. Reynard 2013",2.0
6979,Better than I expected,"The thinkThin Chocolate Fudge flavored bar has a decent texture and an okay flavor.I found the texture to be better than most of this type of bar on the market, unlike most it is not too dry or crunchy; plus you do not need a large glass of liquid such as water or milk to get it down. visually the bar could be a little bit more appealingbut that is possibly because it went through the mail. Would I buy these as a meal replacement? Maybe I would have to try a couple more of the flavors to really decide.",3.0
6984,ThinkThin Fudge Bars... not for me!,"I have tried other ""healthy"" chocolate bars, but I would not recommend this one. Many ""healthy"" bars, although they are not as good as candy bars, of course, have some taste appeal. But there was little taste to this bar. It did, however, taste very artificial. The outer cocoa layer was somewhat bitter, too. When I looked at the nutritional facts, I found that it was not that healthy either. The calories amounted to 240, 70 of which were from fat. For comparison's sake, a regular old Milky Way bar of about the same size contains 240 calories, 80 of which are from fat. The sodium for this bar was 190 mg. The Milky Way contains only 75mg of sodium! The only thing that I thought was any good about this bar was that it was made without gluten. Because this bar neither tastes good nor is healthy, I would not recommend it.",2.0
6985,thinkUgh,"The thinkThin chocolate fudge protein bar is a very underwhelming protein bar.  Boasting 20g of protein, the bar also has 8g of fat, 3 of which are saturated, with 240 calories.  For that, you might as well have a Luna Protein Bar, which is chocolatey, hearty, hefty, filling, and extremely tasty.  This bar is none of those things.The initial bite is reminiscent of a lackluster Three Musketeers bar. The chocolate has a chalky, Play D'oh taste to it.  Another bite, you notice the slightly meaty flavor of the protein (this is a problem from which most high protein bars suffer).  More bites...I honestly can't say.  It's taken me almost a week to eat the whole thing.  It doesn't feel substantial, yet you definitely aren't in the mood for more after a bite or two.Bottom line: you want a lot of protein and you don't care what it tastes like, go for it.  If taste and consistency are concerns, look elsewhere (like the Luna Protein bars).",1.0
6986,Losing weight with these is easy - they're too disgusting to eat,"Just make sure this is your only food source, and i guarantee you'll start dropping pounds. Starvation is a more tempting option than letting these pass your lips.Because i'm a slow learner, i've tried two different flavors: chocolate fudge and chocolate covered strawberry. In both cases, for the first half second or so, i thought they might be decent. The first flicker of flavor is unoffensive. But then that vanishes and something dreadful replaces it. I can't even describe it.There's nothing redeeming in the texture either, something along the lines of fluffy damp sawdust.And lest you think i have a problem with all high-protein meal bars, i assure you, i'm a lazy person and often end up eating zing or clif or builder bars instead of tracking down an actual meal. Some are good, some are decent, some are not so good, but they're all better than these.",1.0

The flavor is chocolate fudge and while there is an element of chocolate it is mired with a bitter aftertaste that is prelude by powdery chalk aspect that haunts my palate.  This protein bar is designed to be a meal replacement, hence the calorie count of 240 and a total fat count of 8 grams.  I would imagine that if a person is willing to sacrifice the calories and fat, this meal replacement bar should taste better.  In addition, this protein bar has cholesterol in it, which I found quite disappointing.  There is no sugar or trans fat in this bar but cholesterol?  I believe I will continue using homemade smoothies as my meal replacement.",2.0
6992,Get your protein without satisfaction,"As others have already stated in their reviews, the bar is loaded with 20g protein and it is a quick fix to curb the appetite, but the taste and texture is pretty poor. Dry but chewy texture, feels like an old fudge bar with chalk or dust in it.If you like this kind of thing then you'll like it I suppose.",2.0
6993,difficult to assess,"It's difficult to assess the healthful qualities or lack thereof because a Vine sticker was placed over the ingredient list. I would describe the chocolate flavor as ""robust,"" rather than ""delicious."" A friend tasting with me thought she detected a chalky aftertaste but I did not notice it. The sweetening agent is maltitol, an alcohol sugar (sorbitol is another popular one) which causes some individuals, myself included, stomach distress and/or diarrhea.  On the plus side, the bar is gluten free, has 20 grams of protein and clocks in at a modest 240 calories. I would say if you are gluten challenged and can tolerate the maltitol (some can) this would be satisfactory as a snack bar.On the other hand, if you find yourself racing for the bathroom, you might want to rethink your relationship with maltitol.",3.0
6994,Worthy but Stale,"I have had dozens of ""thinkThin"" gluten-free bars over the last few years.  If you ask fitness experts like Tom Venuto, you are buying a candy bar with vitamins and protein thrown in it.  However, I've enjoyed supplementing my meals with this nutritious energy boost for some time.  Having a gluten-free diet, I am pleased to report that all the varieties I've tried are tasty and filling enough before or after a workout. (And, anyone who has ""Celiac's Disease"" like I do will vouch for the fact that any designated gluten-free product not tasting like sawdust is usually worth our time and money. Right?)You can get these bars at several grocery stores, and, depending on the purveyor, this product is reasonably priced at about $1.50.  There are 20 grams of protein, and if you have a cross-intolerance to dairy, then, I believe, ""white chocolate"" should be your ideal choice.When this nutritional, meal supplement arrived, I ate it the first day.  ""Chocolate Espresso"" is my favorite flavor, but the item I got was stale.  Instead of it being rich and chewy, it was chalky and crumbly.Don't get me wrong, I love Amazon.  They are my favorite retailer.  It's just that it seems to me the shelf life is most likely shorter at the grocery store or at Wal-Mart than it is from Amazon. I don't know if something needs to be improved from ""thinkThin"" to Amazon or from Amazon to the consumer, but a change needs to happen (hopefully) soon, for the benefit of consumers and pureveyors.",2.0
6995,A DECENT NUTRITIONAL BAR,I am a big fan of Think Thin bars.  They are great for anyone living a low carb lifestyle.  There are quite a few flavors they offer and I was eager to try this one.  It is not one of my favorites as the flavor seems to lack in the espresso area and the chocolate does not taste as rich as the brownie flavor.  Overall it's a decent bar but one I will not purchase in the future.,3.0
7001,This just didn't do it for me,The bar had many nutritional pluses.  Sadly it lacked [at least for me] the one thing I require - taste.  I also thought the texture was undesirable.  I won't be buying any more.,1.0
7002,"OK, but more 'chalky' than others and a bit too sweet for my taste. Cannot really taste the espresso - mostly chocolate.","Protein bars have helped me to lose weight while satisfying late afternoon hunger. My favorite so far have beenPure Protein Bar-Worldwide High Protein Bar, 18/1.76oz Chocolate Peanut Butter, Chewy chocolate chip and chocolate deluxe Bars (new Variety pack). After trying this thinkThin bar, I will stick with the Pure Protein brand.About thinkThin Chocolate Espresso bars:Pros:-Gluten free if that matters to you.-Taste better than some other protein bars I have testedCons:-Can't taste the espresso. There seem to be a couple of nuggets of espresso bean in the filling but that doesn't lead to an overall espresso taste in the bar as a whole.-A little too sweet for my taste-A bit more chalky than the Pure Protein bars I currently useThese bars have just as many calories as the Pure Protein bars, with comparable amounts of saturated and unsaturated fat. Don't assume that this brand is offering you a lower-calorie protein bar.",3.0
7003,Great idea but hard as a brick,"I like the flavor, but these will break your teeth!  I have taken to dipping them in hot coffee to soften them enough to chew, but I won't be ordering more.",2.0
7004,think again,"The positives of this product is that it is gluten free, sugar free and has a reasonable amount of protein, but being pretty much flavor free, these are not enough for me to recommend it.  The first bite was a bit dry but OK with a subtext of coffee flavor.  Sadly, the experience deteriorated from there.  I was unable to discern any espresso flavor in subsequent bites and if blindfolded would have been hard pressed to taste anything in the way of chocolate. Definitely something that needs a large glass of water to help it along.  Few energy bars offer little more than the promise that they can, with any semblance of satisfaction, replace real food.",2.0
7007,"Not that tasty, not a very nice texture, but did satisfy","Since I have only tasted one of these, and cannot back it up with further anecdotal commentary about other tastes and whether I would feel full again with another bar. For the price, they're not as flavorful or have the same pleasant texture as Powerbars or other meal bars I have tried.",3.0
7008,I loved the punch of espresso!,"This is one of the only bars that truly keeps me full. I eat a whole bar and it stays with me for hours. The taste of espresso is really delicious, and especially great if you eat this as a morning meal bar. I loved it from the first bite. Some of these bars contain peanuts so be sure to check the label before you order or consume if you have allergies. While you will not be tricked into thinking you are eating a decadent treat, this bar really does the trick in filling you up so you don't go ahead and indulge in a decadent treat.",5.0
7010,Not impressed,The texture was crumbly and dry. The flavor tasted like a weak cup of espresso with no sweetener and a little cocoa powder. I wasn't impressed and will not purchase these in the future. The only redeeming quality is that they are somewhat good for you.,2.0
7012,Dry and chalky,"I tried a thinkThin Chocolate Espresso bar, and it's an OK, gluten free protein bar, but it's not for me.  They have a decent chocolate taste with some espresso notes, but the texture is dry and chalky, and there's a definite sweetener aftertaste.Despite the ""thinkThin"" brand name, this is basically a protein bar, with 230 calories, 20 grams protein, 8 grams of fat, and 25 grams carbs, including 10 grams sugar alcohol.  Each bar also has about 20 grams of caffeine.All in all, if you're looking for a gluten free protein bar, I think this would be worth a try, but if not, I think there are better choices.",2.0
7013,"Though Not Awful, I Have No Desire for More","I am not too thrilled with these protein bars. The cellulose is dry, and several of the bits, perhaps espresso in the ""Chocolate Espresso"" flavor, in the bar seem to add an odd chew to the mix. I feel like a monkey picking fleas off of a fellow monkey and using my front teeth to bite them in half when I come across these little bits...it's just these tiny, tougher-than-the-other-ingredients bits, and it's weird. I did enjoy the ""Cookies and Cream"" variety.The bar offers a twenty gram boost of protein, though not pleasurably. These are not awful - the flavor is modest, yet accurate - but I have no desire for more of these grainy treats. To their credit, they do satisfy an empty stomach.ThethinkThin ""Crunch""line of various nut roll bars, though not powerhouses of protein, are far more enjoyable than this line of gluten free protein bars.",3.0
7016,"Old School Protein Bars: Decent Flavor, But Relatively High In Calories And Sodium Content","When I received a handful of thinkThin gluten free protein bars in various flavors, I thought that I would absolutely detest them. I read a lot of reviews that complained about the flavors and so I psyched myself up that they were going to be virtually inedible. Nothing could be further from the truth, though. Here's the deal. If you are old enough to remember when protein bars really started to cross over to mainstream appeal, you know they weren't necessarily a taste sensation. You didn't eat them for the taste, however, but for the protein intake. The thinkThin brand reminds me of an old school protein bar. It is tasty enough, but still has a slightly unpleasant aftertaste that sticks with you. Now, of course, there are a lot of alternatives on the market and I've found better tasting bars but I'd certainly take a thinkThin in a pinch.The different flavors vary in content. Of the four I tried, they ranged from 15-20 grams of protein. The calorie count is fairly significant ranging from 200-240 calories and the sodium content is a bit higher than I'd like as that is something that I am specifically watching. Due to these factors, I see thinkThin as more of a meal on the go when you don't have time for anything else as opposed to a regular snack addition.The four that I tried were Cookies & Cream, Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Chocolate Espresso, and White Chocolate. The bar itself is soft and gooey and just coated with a slight covering of flavor. If you are ordering these to be sent, I'd be cautious about leaving them in the hot sun so watch out for the mail!My preference in descending order (supposing all else was equal) in terms of flavor and how it fit with the bar itself:1) Chocolate Espresso2) Chocolate Covered Strawberries3) Cookies & Cream4) White ChocolateMaybe I wouldn't search out this brand in the future, but neither would I avoid it. They are perfectly serviceable, though. KGHarris, 8/13.",3.0
7017,"If you can handle the taste, go for it.","This bar has the makings of a good protein bar.  0 grams of sugar and 20 grams of protein are a solid start.  It was just the chalky, strange taste and the unpleasant dry texture that sealed the deal for me.  I definitely will not be placing an order for a box of these.  If you are still willing to try them out because the ingredient list suits your needs, I would suggest starting with one bar and not a whole box.",2.0
7019,Think Thin Mudslide Bar,"I like that Think Thin makes many flavors for their gluten free high protein bars. This bar tastes okay. I like the coffee beans in it. It has a chocolate taste, with a mocha coffee finish. I think the beans add an extra jolt of energy for me. The bars are really sweet. It takes me about 45 minutes to finish eating one. I have to wash it down with coffee or water. But all the bars are really sweet. I wish they were more natural in ingredients. The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like. I probably won't buy them again unless they are on sale. I will stick to more natural protein snacks (nuts, meat, etc.) even if they are not as convenient.",3.0
7020,Gross,"Yuck.  This bar tastes like chalk and non-food bulk with the slightest hint of chemical-laden chocolate.  There's no way I could get all the way through this thing.  In the event that you are able to eat the whole thing I'm sure it's quite filling, as it's a very heavy, dense bar.  That said, I think the box it came in had better texture and flavor than this thing.  This is only ""food"" in the loosest possible sense of the term.",1.0
7021,Think Thin because you won't be able to eat it.,"Yuck!  This has GOT to be the worse tasting bar I have ever eaten.  It tastes like you are chocking down a bunch of chemicals. Yes, yes I KNOW it says ""all natural"" but really it's gross. I looked up the ingredient list (the ingredient list IS on the back of the bar but on my bar Amazon stuck a sticker right on top of it) and it maybe a form of natural ingredients or maybe what USE TO BE natural ingredients but it's not anymore.Also if you are really looking to avoid products such as MSG, and GMOs this bar isn't for you.  Soy,and Canola are both now primarily GMO unless it's organic.  If you aren't familiar with GMOs it's a good time to learn about them and decide for yourself if it's something you want to consume.  I'm not here to tell you one way or another but I've made the decision to avoid it as much as possible.And regarding ""Natural Flavors"".  What I have heard is ""Natural Flavors"" is industry term ingredients which can contain MSG and / or Aspartame.Just doing a bit of research on the ingredient list of this bar, I can't see how Think Thin can get away with calling itself ""All Natural"".  It really should be called ""Deprived from Natural Ingredients"" or ""What was once natural ingredients but now is in a unrecognizable form"".INGREDIENTS: PROTEIN BLEND (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, CALCIUM CASEINATE, CASEIN), GLYCERIN, COATING (MALTITOL, COCOA BUTTER, CHOCOLATE, SODIUM CASEINATE, MILK FAT, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SALT), MALTITOL, ALKALIZED COCOA, COCOA SOY CRISPS (SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, ALKALIZED COCOA, TAPIOCA STARCH), PEANUTS, WATER, CANOLA OIL, NATURAL FLAVORS, SOY LECITHIN, COFFEE.CONTAINS: MILK, PEANUTS, SOY.MANUFACTURED IN A PLANT THAT ALSO PROCESSES EGGS AND TREE NUTS.GLUTEN FREE Certified Gluten Free by GFCO, gfco.orgMaltitol is a sugar alcohol and is artificially produced (according to various sources).Sodium caseinate is the biochemical name for casein. Casein is the name for a family of related phosphoproteins . These proteins are commonly found in milk.For 230 calories a bar and 20 grams of protein I think a person could do better for their body and have something tastier to eat.  Perhaps a few eggs?",1.0
7022,Really bad,"The only word appropriate for describing this product is gross. I eat a lot of protein bars, my favorite being Quest bars. I tend to steer clear of protein bars that have that artificial/chemical flavor and unfortunately these fall into that category for me. Some flavors are better than others and although I wouldn't consider this one the worst (that title belongs to the cookies & cream variety), that's not to say this one was much better.These have that typical ""protein bar"" texture that's a bit difficult to explain... it's somewhat dry and crumbly and almost seems to dissolve in your mouth as you chew, and the flavor was sickening and very artificial tasting. Everything about this bar just tasted so unnatural and I've come to expect more from protein products at this price point.Overall I found this bar to be awful and cannot recommend this product.",1.0
7023,Mostly good,"DANG!  This is DELICIOUS!!!Now for the ""But"".....thinkThin has 230 calories AND Soy Protein Isolate.  I'm good with the Whey protein but soy protein isolate raises insulin and actually makes a person gain weight. (Something to do with estrogen.  I can't remember the exact connection.)  HELLO!  Maybe it's a thinkchubby bar.It's basically a protein packed candy bar/brownie and if you think of it as such - IT ROCKS.  If I were younger and more active I'd buy lots of these but they're a little too calorie dense for me.",3.0
7024,Decent tasting chocolate-flavored protein bar -- a bit dry but not chalky,"I've tried lots of protein and meal replacement bars over the years. Some taste better than others. Some are better for you than others.The Think Thin bars have good ingredients, and taste better than lots of the others I've tried.This one, as expected, is chocolatey with a hint of espresso. It's got a think outer coating of chocolate, with a somewhat dry brownie type filling.It's comparable to similar flavored Balance Bars, but I think this one has better ingredients - although I tend to prefer the texture of the Zone bars.The protein comes from whey and soy, and the whole thing is gluten free, but has milk and peanuts. It's got no sugar, and 20grams of protein, for a snack that will give you energy much longer than a candy bar.",3.0
7025,"Thick and clunky chocolate, kinda yucky!","For a healthy snack, the thinkThin Chocolate Espresso is not what I expected. I've eaten a few types of popular nutrition bars before, and they are either the really fruity-soft kind or the really nutty-hard kind, none have been like this --- the soft-but-hard kind. Let me explain, the thinkThin is a 2/3"" thick piece of chocolate bar formed with expresso inside, it's a very dense heavy chunk mushed together. And while you're suppose to 'think thin', the bar gives the opposite impression! And after taking several bites, you certainly dont feel thin, it's a very clunky taste, sort of soft but dry and hard paste that doesn't even have a very good flavor. Feels sort of like eating cardboard if cardboard had an edible texture! And you will need a drink to wash down your healthy bar!I do taste the expresso, not really the chocolate cause it's just a mess of flavors and none really stand out. It sure tastes healthy, if healthy means it has no [good] taste and we all know, healthy is something most people don't enjoy eating but only because they have to!""High Protein. Low glycemic. Sugar free, Wheat free. Gluten free. 0g trans fat. All natural. 20g of protein. 2g effective carbs. Best taste. No ingredients produced using biotechnology- wow, if this is what biotech does to food, NO THANK YOU! Please take technology out of the process...machines do not have tastebuds, that's why this thinkThin bar has ZERO taste. Definitely no sugar, which is why it's like eating cardboard, which also doesn't have sugar but lots of protein! ;)""Delicious wholesome weight management"" - because after you eat this, you'll not want to eat anymore since it ruins your tongue/appetite.Not recommended. Yikes. Worst tasting health bar ever, think I'll go back to fruits and nuts, thinkThin has someone managed to destroy chocolate and expresso ;(",1.0
7026,Not too impressed,"I have tried many protein bars and don't like this as well as other brands. I found the taste a little fake. I much prefer the KIND bars (my favorite) or even the Builder's bars, which also can have a fake taste.  I ate this, but won't buy more.",3.0
7028,No Taste to the bar!,I have tried this bar numerous times and I do not like it. It's like eating cardboard.,1.0
7029,Good Flavor but...,"I enjoyed the flavor of chocolate espresso in this bar, but found the texture too mealy.  I would be interested in trying some of the other flavors, but at the price, won't rush out to do so.",3.0
7030,Dry and bland,"This review is based on a single bar provided by the Amazon Vine program.I eat a lot of ""bars"" from protein bars, to snack bars.  This bar is small, but packs 230 calories, 20 grams of protein, no sugar, and 25 grams of carbs.  The chocolate covering had good flavor, and consistency.  It wasn't too waxy or melty.  The interior is a single mass of dry filling.  It had a vague chocolately espresso taste, but wasn't good.  It was also very dry.If you need gluten free, it may be an ok option, but I'll be looking elsewhere.",2.0
7032,"Great protein, not so great taste","I realize that the number one reason people eat these bars is to get a protein boost, but can't they make them taste better?  I picked to sample the one I thought I'd like the most, only to find it rather unpleasant.  The texture and taste were not to my liking.  I understand this isn't a cookie or brownie or a dessert, but it's more like medicine than something you'd want to eat.  This is quite subjective, I admit, and wholly a matter of personal taste.  I was prepared to like this, and was looking forward to trying it.  I'm surprised to be writing an unfavorable review.  Nonetheless I'd recommend this to people with low energy; it's a far better product than those dangerous energy drinks.  At least it is a healthy product, if not a treat.",3.0
7033,"Mediocre flavor, gritty texture.","I ate one and threw the rest away. That should sum up how I feel about these supposed ""ThinkThin"" candy bars. They are definitely not Nutrition bars as they do not contain anything close to nutritious. I get snack attacks and am always looking for something healthy to munch on other than fruit. So far the only bars that I have found to be even close to healthy and that taste reasonably good are Zone bars. These ThinkThin bars do not have much flavor and have an unpleasantly gritty texture. It amazes me when companies will call candy bars healthy and nutritious when they are far from it. These ThinkThin bars contain Fat and Sugar but No Vitamins. The front of the package says 0g of Sugar but the ingredients list 10g of Sugar Alcohol (Maltitol). The only good aspect to these candy bars are that they are Gluten Free but they do contain Soy. If Gluten Free (but with Soy is ok) is your overriding requirement and you don't care about flavor, taste or grittiness then you might want to try these ThinkThin bars. If you are watching your diet or trying to lose weight, not sure that these bars would be a good idea.",1.0
7036,Not a good taste,"The Chocolate Espresso flavor of the thinkThin bars is the only one I have tasted and I found it disappointing.  There was no coffee flavor to the bar other than bitterness.  Is that supposed to be the espresso flavor?  I have tasted many other things with a better coffee flavor.  The chocolate flavor is strong but more of a baking chocolate flavor, not candy flavor.  Of course since the bar contains zero sugar, barely any fat, and is gluten free, it isn't going to have a ""rich"" flavor to it. It contains 20 grams of protein but only 10% Calcium and 15% Iron for the RDA.  It leaves a strong after taste that made me grab for a beverage to get rid of it.  If you like a bitter chocolate flavor, then you would like this bar.  Personally I won't be eating another of this flavor.",1.0
7037,Tasty But Too Many Calories,These are a tasty meal replacement bar though relatively high in calories.  The Expresso flavor is quite subtle and chocolate is definitely the dominant flavor.  I am not gluten free and I much prefer Special K bars when I need a quick meal replacement bar for busy times.,3.0
7038,Not for me,"I was looking forward to trying these bars as a good mid afternoon snack.  It is really difficult to get gluten free bars that have a nice texture to it so this bar falls into the ""to be improved"" category.  The texture is chalky and dense.  The flavor was not as bad but it had some aftertaste to it.  This bar tasted like cocoa powder mixed with some protein powder (the chalky kind), then some oil (or glycerin as it states) and some sweetener.  In this case it contains maltitol which is a sugar alcohol.  I had an upset stomach for several hours and then lots, I mean LOTS of gas....not cool....won't be buying this, sorry.",2.0
7039,Tasty Snack (But Higher in Calories that I Expected),"This was a yummy snack - I loved the coffee flavor of the chocolate bar. I felt like it was a little higher in calories than I would want to eat for something as healthy as it was supposed to be. But for someone that is gluten free and in need of a sweet treat, this was delicious!",3.0
7040,"Edible, but barely...","I've tried many bars that are out there on the market.  They all seem to be either hit or miss with me.  These are a miss.  I don't care for them.The taste is not that great.  The texture is not very good either.  The size isn't bad for 230-240 calories but I just don't care for them.  They aren't so bad that I can't finish them but I just don't care to.Chocolate Espresso- I found them to be only a tiny bit on the chalky side but they are quite a bit gritty.  I don't taste a very strong Espresso flavor.  Didn't like the flavor at all.White Chocolate- These were a tiny bit better but not by much.  The White Chocolate bar was just coated in White Chocolate but it wasn't a yummy White Chocolate.  It was lacking the yummy White Chocolate flavoring that I love.Chunky Peanut Butter-  These were also a tiny bit better but again, not by much.  The Chunky Peanut Butter didn't really taste a lot like Peanut Butter.  It was lacking flavor and I didn't really see/feel any chunks either.  There were some tiny little pieces that I felt while chewing but they were really, really small and it felt like chewing on unflavored coconut or paper.  It was just odd.Brownie Crunch- I didn't find this bar to be much different from the Chocolate Espresso.  Didn't like the flavor at all.  Not much like a brownie in my opinion and there was no crunch.Dark Chocolate- Although I liked the dark chocolate coating, I still didn't care for the inside.Chocolate Fudge-  This one wasn't as bad as the others but I still wouldn't say it was good.  It was just more edible.  Coating wasn't bad and the inside is the same as the rest, not good.I have some other flavors to try and although I'm hoping I'll find one of those to be more to my liking, I'm starting to think that's not going to happen.Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend any of the bars that's I've tried.",2.0
7041,The White Chocolate is Delicious But Not the Espresso Chocolate,"I made a mistake mixing up two diferent flavors of bars in my former review of this item so this review is a correction.  The white chocolate bar is delicious.  It does not have the typical and unpleasant flavor of many protein bars.  It is lightly sweet but just enough.  The coating is a layer of white chocolate.  The inside is not grainy but rich.  It is very satisfying and does the job of filling you up for a few hours of activities.  The item is does not contain sugar and it is not at all a candy bar.  Highly recommended.  However, the espresso chocolate version is chalky, graining and had no taste of either chocolate or espresso.  Not recommended.",3.0

For taste alone, I would give these 5 stars for people who like sweets. For people who want a healthy snack, I wouldn't recommend these. Overall I am giving it 3 stars because while these may taste good, it's only due to being very sweet due to lots of sugar and corn syrup. Also, while the impression may be that these are good for you being only 90 calories (it's only a .8 ounce bar anyway), I certainly wouldn't say they are. They also contain artificial flavors.",3.0

7122,What a disappointment. just a candy bar,First  If I could have rated this ZERO STARS.. I would havI would like to say I am a regular eater of protein bars. This is NOTHING like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar..1. it is extremely SMALL.. it didn't even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in. Approx 2/3 of the size of a usual bar2. it is Thin as well as short...3. Extremely sweet and modest crunch4. It might only measure 90 calories but most of those come from simple Sugar- the first 3 ingredients are SUGAR...So if you want a sugar high fine but if your  are looking for a  healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there.So inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item.

7127,All stale; some opened; none w/ Exp. Date,"I buy all my cereal from Amazon. I am usually very pleased with products received from Amazon. This box of cereal bowls contained several bowls that were open! All of the varieties I tried were stale and didn't taste right; and the Raisin Bran actually seemed rotten. The first thing I did after encountering these problems was to check for an expiration or use by date. There was no indication on any of the packaging ANYWHERE as to when these bowls of cereal would no longer be appropriate for human consumption. By comparison, the General Mills cereals I've purchased from Amazon have expiration dates on each and every individual bowl (usually printed on the bottom). Kellogg's makes great cereals - I have no problem with Kellogg's - I think I got a bad box that had been stored away in the back of some warehouse somewhere that should have been discarded because it was way past its shelf-life. Amazon, of course, refunded my money. But, just beware that it could happen to you and if it does be sure to get Amazon to refund your money. Amazon's warehouses need to be more vigilant.

It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems.

One 1.76-ounce pouch of Cinnamania Cinnamon Buns comes in at a whopping 230 calories with a significant 30% from fat. The contents consist of several small graham cracker-type cookies with a white sugar glaze to simulate rather half-heartedly the look of a cinnamon bun. The consistency, however, perhaps due to the enriched wheat flour, is anything but and a pale imitation of what you would buy at a Starbucks or bake from a Pillsbury roll-up package.In fact, the weakly-named Cinnamania is more akin to something from Mother's Cookies, the kind of unmemorable confection you would find in one of those big bags you get at discount on Costco. The flavor is not bad, just undistinguished considering how it has been positioned as a proxy for a freshly-baked bun. The package exclaims that it's a ""Good Source of Calcium and 4 Vitamins"", but it hardly warrants an endorsement for its questionable nutritional value. If you have a need for a cinnamon bun, then I suggest you go to your nearest Cinnabon in order to justify the calorie intake.",2.0

Since 'enriched flour' is the primary ingredient it does contain a small sprinkling of a few vitamins and it has a little added calcium carbonate for calcium too.BOTTOM LINE: SEALED IN MYLAR THIS STUFF CAN LAST A LONG TIME![notice I didn't say STAY FRESH]If you can tolerate the excess of sugar, salt and fat in this product and like the taste too, then this may be an acceptible choice for an on-the-go snack in a pinch.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]",3.0
7147,"The flavor is okay, but too much fat.","The package for these cookies looks very inviting.  I was hoping that the flavor of the cookies would be as delicious as the package.  The cookies taste okay, though much less inviting than the picture on the package, and are significantly less delicious than genuine, fresh-baked cinnamon rolls.  Worse, these cookies list sugar as the second largest ingredient and corn syrup as their fifth largest ingredient.  Any product with that much sugar and corn syrup is unable to convince me that it is a ""healthy"" product, regardless of how many vitamins or other wholesome ingredients the product has.There are better tasting cookies, and there are cookies that are more up front about their calories.  I am always suspicious of any cookie that claims to be healthy.  Adding a few vitamins to sugar and corn syrup fails to make this cookie a health food.  Do yourself a favor and either eat a genuine cinnamon roll, or get yourself some fruit and have a truly healthy snack.This review is based on a sample of the product provided to me by Amazon.Good luck!",2.0
7148,Where's the bun?,"Some, of course, object to the hype of ""A good source of calcium & 4 vitamins,"" but at least the company added some nutritional value.  The list of ingredients is a bit odd--some B vitamins are identified as such, some aren't.  With so much fat & sugar, this product certainly isn't health food.  It's not cinnamon buns either--but what can you expect from what is basically an iced cinnamon cookie?  At only 50g, one will survive an occasional indulgence--convenient for lunch box, aircraft carryon, etc.  The taste is pretty good, IMHO.  Lots of wheat though--gluten doesn't like me much.  It is nice to see a company (Kellog's) branching out--this isn't a cereal.  However, many of the the cookies in my package were broken.  Didn't effect the flavor, but lots of crumbs.",3.0

Either way I popped some anyways. It's surprisingly good, it's not great though. It has more negatives than positives. The positives are that it has a sweet taste for sure, nothing chemical or weird though. That's about it for the positives. The negatives are that you need to eat a handful or the popcorn is bland, if you eat it in small handfuls THEN it tastes sugary and sweet. The popcorn is also cold, coming right out of the microwave, I think this is due to it not really having any coating like butter so it gets cold fast......I like warm popcorn. It's also really light and dry.......I like buttery popcorn. All in all this popcorn is good tasting and I am really picky about this stuff and artificial sweeteners, it doesn't taste fake or chemical to me. Have you ever had a popcorn ball?

It's nicely salted with a light fluffy texture.  The first time we popped it, I was surprised to find out that it really was more tender than Orville's regular popcorn.The downside is that you trade off fiber for tenderness.  The ""Tender White"" you see has half the fiber of ""Ultimate Butter"" for example.  And what's more surprising, it has more fat. ""Tender White"" has 13grams versus 11 grams for ""Ultimate Butter"".  (You would think it would be vice-versa.)THE SKINNY:::Excellent, tasty popcorn.

But I'd buy these when I want a lemon cookie kick ...","So, maybe I should judge these from a gluten free perspective and not just a cookie one. But well, that's tough. I like Pamela's pancakes (the only gluten free ones hubby really enjoys). So, I gave three of the cookies a shot.Mind you, they are NOT bad. The lemon flavor is terrific. Really tangy and strong. That made me happy. The crumbly texture, not so much. BUT..with a cuppa tea, when the urge for a cookie strikes--and given I can't bake to save my life, well, if I wanna cookie, someone else will have to make it for me--these will do nicely.I would recommend these for folks who want a ""not full of lots of weird crap"" gluten free cookie if they love a robust lemon flavor. This fits the bill.I also tried the swirl and chocolate chunk varieties. I'd pass on the swirl, personally. The chocolate chunk had a nicer flavor. Both of those were uber crumbly. If you're used to the texture of gluten-free cookies, fine. If not, beware. They are powdery, crumbly, fall apart easily. I've had them totally pulverize in delivery--just turn to utter crumbs.If I were to recommend a cookie to a gluten free eater who liked lemony flavor, so far, this would be the one. I'd consider buying again--not too soon--when cookie cravings hit. 3 to 3.5 stars, depending on my mood the day I nibble em. ; )",3.0

7255,"Good, but...","This mix is easy to prepare and makes nice, light pancakes, but I find I have to add 2 to 3 teaspoons of vanilla for flavor or else they don't taste like much. I tried using the recipe on the side of the package for chocolate chip cookies, and they were terrible - the taste and texture weren't good at all. Then I tried the waffle recipe. They were ok, but again, they didn't taste like much. And if you don't eat them all right away, they get soggy; freezing and toasting didn't help much, they just burned in the toaster. So far, the best recipe I have found for waffles/pancakes comes from the book The Best Gluten Free Family Cookbook by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt. You have to buy several flours (sorghum, almond, brown rice, and soy) and two starches to make the mix, but it's totally worth it. As for Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix, I know everyone else raves about it, and for pancakes the texture is surprisingly like regular wheat pancakes, but taste is blah and the other recipes aren't very good. I used up my case of 6, but won't be repurchasing.UPDATE**I had been unhappy with using this as a baking mix until I tried the recipe for muffins on the side of the bag. I made them exactly as directed, using honey and frozen blueberries as the fruit. They are delicious.

What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan, kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.

7313,"Good texture, flat flavor","I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon.

7324,Really good when fresh,"This was one of the first bread mixes I tried after learning I couldn't tolerate gluten.  Fresh out of the oven it is amazing to eat with just some butter/jam on it.  It even smelled like real bread when baking and was just incredibly yummy freshly baked.  I could have eaten the entire life, haha!  But I found the next day it was not as good, even with retoasting it in the oven.  It was very heavy and dense and had a strange bitter taste to it.  Because of the dense texture though I think this would work really well for sweet breads.  I tried using it as a pizza crust and it was just way too heavy and overpowering of more delicate flavors like cheese and mushrooms.  The flours used in this were a little hard on my tummy too.  Overall it is okay, but I am not amazed.  I would probably skip this unless I plan to use the whole loaf fresh from baking or just for sweet breads.",3.0

If your intent is to go wheat free - in the literal sense, this also meets the bill.  But if your intent is to go wheat free in the sense of the book Wheat Bellies and avoid high glycemic index foods that promote high insulin and fat retention - this is NOT the product to do it.  As indicated in the Wheat Bellies blog ...Wheat raises blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods, including table sugar and many candy bars. The few foods that increase blood sugar higher than even wheat include figs, dates, and other dried fruits, and rice starch, cornstarch, tapioca starch, and potato starch-the most common ingredients used in gluten-free foods. A gluten-free whole grain bread, for instance, is usually made with a combination of brown rice, potato, and tapioca starches. These dried pulverized starches are packed with highly-digestible high-glycemic index carbohydrates and thereby send blood sugar through the roof. This contributes to diabetes, cataracts, arthritis, heart disease and growing belly fat. This is why many celiac patients who forego wheat and resort to gluten-free foods become fat and diabetic. Gluten-free foods as they are currently manufactured are very poor substitutes for wheat flour.I took a look at this product so that I may have some bread - wheat free.  This is not a good substitute.",1.0

SHe kept trying to pick out just the chocolate chips.For myself, it was OK. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can have a grainy aftertaste and that was the case with these.

7370,Was: Whole Cookies! Now: Still arrive as mostly crumbs,"Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookiesOriginal review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.",3.0

7387,"Best gluten free chocolate cake, hands down","Since my diagnosis of celiac disease, my family and I have tried several gluten free cake mixes, all of them ranging from ""yuck"" and ""at least it's cake"" to ""mildly disappointing.""  Pamela's cake is the best, no question.  Not only is it free of dairy and soy (along with wheat, I cannot digest legumes, and many gluten free products seem to rely on bean flour), but it makes TWO layers of cake.  Compare that to Betty Crocker, who, bless her heart, tried to introduce a gluten free cake mix, only to have it make one measly layer.With one bag of Pamela's cake mix, you can make a two layer birthday cake for your favorite person with celiac.  This cake is so moist, and yes, the texture does change a bit over sitting, but we like our cakes denser, not so fluffy they flop around on our forks.  Usually I'm more a fan of the frosting than the cake, but this is a cake you could serve without frosting.Also, it's easy to make. My husband and kids made this without any practice, and they are not experienced gluten free bakers. It's easy as pie. Or cake.  We'll be trying the vanilla variety very soon!Thanks, Pamela!",5.0
7403,Great for pie crust - already in crumbs!,"From a Gluten-Free subscriber. Oh dear. I ordered this from Amazon because it is a dollar less per box than in the Martin's store in their gluten-free aisle, and these are the best chocolate GF cookies we have ever eaten. BUT! The cookies arrived totally broken into very small pieces and loads of crumbs. Guess they would be great for a pie crust, tho. What a dissapointment. They are somewhat tender to begin with, and I don't know how Amazon can package them in a special way to prevent such destruction. We all know how packages are treated by the carriers who deliver them....not delicately, that's for sure. So, will never order these by mail again and must pay the exorbitent price the go for at Martin's. Pooh!",1.0

Amazon has them at a great price to sell too as my local Jimbo's sells them for $3.85 for the 5.29 oz box.  They keep fresh a long time.

The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4""), dry, and brittle.

Out of pure desperation I grabbed a box of Pamela's Products Dark Chocolate Chunk cookies, hoping that the taste of chocolate might obfuscate whatever was being substituted for delicious, gluten-containing wheat.I was impressed.  These double-chocolate cookies are delicious.  They taste as good or better than any non-GF cookie I have ever tasted.  There was no sense of sacrifice or substitution.  Nothing was ""missing"" or ""off"" in the flavor.  The flavor of chocolate in both the dough and the chunks came through perfectly.  The cookies tasted sweet, but not overly sweet.The cookies also have a nice balance between crunch and chewiness.  When you bite in, you feel an initial crunchiness but then your teeth sink into the dough, giving you a sense of chewiness, as well.A really tasty cookie.  I'd serve these to guests any day.",5.0

One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently, I did not eat it. I was not sad, but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway, I made these brownies tonight. Since I like cake-like brownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor), I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 1/4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans, so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good brownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies. My brownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose-free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events.

For example, Myojo Udon puts out these delectable packets (seeMyojo Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Soup Base, Chicken Flavor, 7.22-Ounce Bag (Pack of 15)) that can be had for about a dollar and they are way more flavorful than this particular bowl. (Don't buy them from Amazon, though, get them at your local Asian grocer's or trusty online retailer).Of course, the Myojo Udon type noodles aren't as ""easy"" to prepare as Annie Chun bowls (you can't really nuke them in a microwave; you have to boil them, then add a flavor packet).

I even added less water like reviews suggested and it didn't help at all. I've also tried Annie's Udon soup and it's gross as well. I won't be trying anymore of Annie's soups, they seem to all have a similar flavor that is just bland and disgusting.",1.0

7599,Pretty good if you add stuff,"The udon tastes okay by itself but is not very filling. If you add other things such as more red pepper flakes, meat, mushrooms, etc it becomes much better. Otherwise decent if you are not a fan of the other instant noodles such as cup ramen.",4.0

The sodium is a bit high but much better than other instant noodles.Also good for earthquake and emergency kits, though they need some water to rehydrate.",3.0
7606,Just OK,"Being Korean, I thought I'd try these kimchi bowls in lieu of the traditional ramen's that are loaded w/ preservatives and MSG. These bowls were just OK. They taste more like gochujang (red hot chili paste) more than kimchi, though. It was pretty spicy for me... couldn't finish the broth, but others I shared w/ were fine w/ the spice level.I may buy these again only as back-up if there's nothing to eat, not b/c it's something that's delicious.",3.0

7611,Disappointed :  (,"My first experience with Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls was the Kimchi.  It is awesome. I highly recommend that one. Recently Annie Chun products were on sale so I bought the Miso as Amazon was out of Kimchi.  I love Miso so I figured it would be as good as the Kimchi only not spicy.  Wrong.  I've had Kikkoman instant miso soup before and it has a better miso flavor. And I ate it plain.  I added spinach, tofu and a a touch of sliced mushrooms to Annie's and it still was just ok. It does have the noodles though--they're fun.  But my opinion is that if you like miso you will find this lacking.  I will not be purchasing this one again.",3.0

I'm enjoying it like that, but I'm not likely to buy it again - just not my taste.",3.0
7631,Love this soup!,Just the right amount of spice (spicy!) the texture of the noodles was great and it was delicious.  I wish they were cheaper but our entire family loves these.  My only problem is the amount of carbs and salt but at least the fat was a huge amount lower than packaged noodle soups.  (3g a bowl vs about 12g+ for many other brands).  I'll buy these again.

I've had other Annie Chun's products and loved them, so I was unpleasantly surprised with this purchase. I couldn't even finish the entire bowl - in fact, I still have the 5 other bowls sitting in my cupboard. It was a good idea, but poor execution. I still intend to try another bowl in case the one I got was somehow bad, but I got the feeling that wasn't the case. The reason I gave it two stars was because the noodles were fine, and in general I like Annie Chun's products.",2.0
7642,yum,"I bought these because they have less salt than other versions.  They are very tasty. While they are not ""low sodium"" by any means they have enough less to make it worthwhile to me... about 700 mg for the whole bowl - which is considered 1 serving, not 1/2 a bowl as with others and then double the sodium.  The price is about what I pay in the store with shipping, so I went for the convenience of to my door delivery.",4.0
7643,"Pleasant ginger taste, soft non fried noodle, but a bit bland. An 'on sale' purchase only","I thought that adding ginger to chicken soup was pleasantly tasty, but it was a bit bland. I wish this had more ginger flavor. If you dont have MSG, or more salt, you gotta add something. The vegetables were still pretty hard - I cooked it by adding boiling water and waiting 3 minutes. Also, there was a very small amount of pieces of vegetables. I think even one or two actual slices of mushroom would increase the perceived value greatly. The noodles reconstituted nicely, as they do with all versions of these soups, and there was a nice serving of them. I would have liked to see maybe even slightly less noodles if it meant more vegetables. An optional spice flavor packet would be really nice too.I didnt think this was bad but I wasnt that impressed. This would probably be improved with a little soy sauce or spice. I know they are trying to limit the salt but i've had other soups with 1000mg of sodium (the amount in this soup - they claim 2 servings but thats a joke and deceives many people) or less, and it tasted better. Also, when cooking, do not use more water then specified. 1 cup is enough; any more will substantially dilute the taste. I would recommend trying this once but after that, unless its $1.50 or less, I dont think its a repeat for me.I saw this at my local publix for - get this - a whopping $4.79. Its certainly NOT worth that price. With annie chun you are partly paying for the gimmick - the cornstarch recyclable packaging, charity donations, organic ingredients, no msg (although does contain yeast extract which has free glutimates I believe..), etc.My recommendation is to only pick this up if you see it on sale, and then add in something extra - maybe even more ginger. If you are able, some diced chicken would really improve this soup. If you are on the go, you could also add canned chicken breast since its shelf stable. I think the overall consensus is that if you were to try any one of these annie chun soups, try the udon.",3.0

Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, this one is a major disappointment.The noodles are fabulous, and the veggies reconstitute very well, as with all Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking.  I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup.

This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up.  I could practically live off of this stuff!Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating!",5.0
7674,Nothing like hot & sour soup - and awful into the bargain.,"Perhaps Annie Chun (and the rest of the manufacturers on the hot & sour bandwagon) understand hot and sour soup to be a completely different animal than I do.  Then again - maybe not.After discovering a love for hot and sour soup at our local Chinese restaurant, I thought I'd try some of the store brands that said ""hot and sour"" on them.  BIG mistake.  The hot and sour soup I am used to is a flavorful, robust soup with chunks of tofu, pork meat, bamboo shoots, egg and dried mushrooms laced throughout it.  It is slightly tangy affair and a bit spicy on the palette.By contrast - oh dear.  Annie Chun has fallen into the same pitfalls the others have when trying to make a store-brand, prepackaged hot and sour soup.  I must admit I was interested when I saw that the noodles were 'fresh' rather than dried - but when you add hot water to them, along with the 'flavor' packet and hot oil sachet.......ugh.  Tastes like someone strained a whole head of garlic and some chillies through a sieve and into a bowl of boiling water.The dried veggies (most noticeably the green onions) are godawful.  They have a consistency more akin to bad calamari, and a taste that more closely resembles cardboard (don't ask how I know what cardboard tastes like).Just awful.  Do yourself a favor - go to your nearest Chinese restaurant, and order like ten servings of hot and sour soup.  It's usually about $3-a-pop, and portion it out into individual freezer-safe tubs or sandwich bags.  Freeze.  Extract one-at-a-time from the freezer when you have the craving.  MUCH HAPPIER!!",1.0

Some aren't too bad when doctored with some soy sauce, hot sauce, or other sauce. And some aren't too bad for ease of preparation.This one isn't easily doctored, nor is it that fast/simple to make. Therefore I don't see any reason to keep in the pantry. If I don't feel like spending 20-30 minutes to make my own Asian food from scratch, I'll stick with better/easier ready-made products to keep on hand.",2.0

The noodles cook well but are only average in the flavor department.

It tasted like pure vinegar. The sauce was SO SOUR. The acidity overpowered any soy or sesame flavor by a long shot. The only thing I can think is that in order to compensate for the dish being lower sodium than most noodle bowl type things, they tried to ramp up the flavor with acidic ingredients. A touch of acidity does help bring out the flavor when you reduce the salt, but this was WAY too much.",1.0

7722,"Excellent tea, despite the misleading name!","Recently, I've been searching for a good ginger tea. Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger. After trying the Organic Ginger Aid tea by Traditional Medicinals and being disappointed (see my review on that) I decided to try out this tea instead.  So, how was it?Well, it was good and bad.  It has ""Spicy Ginger"" in its title, but it's not spicy at all and you can't really taste the ginger.  So in that sense its pretty bad.  However, its still delicious as a tea, and has a very pleasant lemony flavor (probably due to the lemon myrtle).  I don't normally like lemony-tasting teas, but I absolutely loved this one, so that really says something.  Unfortunately, this tea doesn't really satisfy my craving for ginger flavor.  I would recommend it, however, to those who want the health benefits of ginger but hate the taste.  This would be perfect for those sorts of people.I later discovered that you can make an excellent ginger tea by just boiling some fresh ginger root slices in water.  This resulted in excellent spicy ginger tea and was very cheap to make (since ginger roots are pretty inexpensive).  So, I really recommend this method over buying this tea if you just want ginger flavor.  However, I'll still probably buy this tea since I love it's taste so much otherwise.  In fact, if you are just looking for a tasty good tea (and don't care about having ginger flavor) then I recommend you pick this up.  I only wish they'd change the name to something like ""Lemon Myrtle Organic Blend"" or some such so that it would more accurately describe the taste that buyers are going to get.  Other than that, though, it gets 4/5 stars simply for still being delicious.",4.0

This black tea on the other hand is so strong that if properly brewed it completely kills my taste buds. Sometimes one wants bagged teas to quickly make oneself a cup, but not at such taste disadvantage.

However, the so-called ""teriyaki"" sauce is terrible. First, it doesn't taste like teriyaki. Secondly, the sauce kind of tastes like watered down ketchup. If you've ever actually added ketchup to your ramen noodles, you'll know what I mean. It's that slightly tangy, slightly sweet taste you get when you haven't yet put enough ketchup or seasoning to taste. Needless to say, I felt gypped.

7773,Very surprised by all the positive feedback...,"I don't typically eat processed foods but I was sold on their mission statement of offering convenient, healthy, delicious meals made with only natural and organic ingredients (100% Natural, No MSG, No Preservatives).  I bought several to keep at my office, unfortunately, these Noodle Bowls are just barely edible in my opinion.The first one I tried was late last year.  They were the Teriyaki Noodles and after trying to convince myself that it wasn't 'that bad', I finally tossed it after just several bites.  I refused to touch the other bowls in my desk after that experience but also didn't throw them out because it seemed like such a waste.  Today, out of hunger and laziness, I finally tried the Kung Pao Noodle Bowl.  While I did find this one to be more palatable and finished all but just a few bites, it really isn't something I could recommend to anyone.The Teriyaki Sauce and Noodles were just gross.  The Kung Pao Sauce was at least tasty but the Noodles were still funky.  Basically, the noodles are pre-cooked and vacumed sealed for you.  Out of their packaging, they smell like playdoh and they look weird - like soft rubber - not like a food item.  You add boiling water (or microwave them with water) to basically re-heat them, drain and add the sauce.  I love the concept but that weird playdoh smell just never disapears and I find it hard to convince my brain that I'm actually eating noodles and not some weird inorganic product.  With the Kung Pao noodles, I chose to use boiling water (over the microwave method I used the first time) and after straining the noodles I repeated the process a second time with more boiling water to better 'rinse' the noodles.  This seemed to get rid of the weird smell a bit more and the sauce was flavorful enough that it covered up most of the remaining weird noodle smell taste.The last one I have in my drawer is the Pad Thai flavor.  I'm in no rush to try it but of course, won't throw it out (I hate being wasteful like that) but once it's gone, I will not be purchasing any more Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls.",1.0

Disgusting.Then the most recent order, June 2012, arrived with rancid sauce and rancid peanuts unfit for consumption.Now we're not sure if we're game to try our luck with these any further.

I truly cannot imagine how people can say it's ""delicious"". It doesn't even taste like Teriyaki.

I used a lot of soy sauce and did eat them, though.Since I have 5 more bowls, I have a chance to find a way to cook them so that I like them better and am thinking some frozen mixed vegetables and chunks of canned chicken would be a good addition.

7821,Surprisingly good,"I will preface this review by saying that I have tried several of the Annie's line of soups and noodles, and I have yet to find one I enjoy eating.  I also greatly dislike spicy and/or fishy tasting foods.I was very pleasantly surprised by this noodle bowl.  I mean - admittedly I managed to paint the kitchen walls with the first one I bought.......but, user error aside, my second experience was much more positive.  This bowl comes with the noodles, dried veggies (small amount), peanuts to top and also the sauce sachet.Newbies to this product would be well advised to use half of the sauce packet to begin with - and then add the rest if they desire after tasting.  While it doesn't look like a huge amount of sauce - it is very highly flavored.  It is a nicely sweet-and-sour condiment with a hint of fish paste on the back of the palette.  It is also a little salty - but I do not share other reviewer's opinions with it being far too salty.The biggest surprise I found with the sauce was that it was actually quite spicy - while the packaging described it as mild and pretty much not at all spicy.  This meal ranked a 7 on my 0-10 scale of tolerability for spicy foods, with me being a person who prefers no spice at all.  But the spiciness wasn't completely unpleasant, per se, either - it did set off the other flavors quite well.Definitely use the peanuts that come with this bowl - they are a great addition to it, assuming you can lift them with your chopsticks!  ;-)",4.0

Out of personal preference I like the lightly salted versions of chips, nuts, etc. I want to taste the food more than the salt. They have sprinkled these peanut butter crackers on the outside with salt, so I rub as much of this off as possible, but they still taste too salty to me. The peanut butter is yummy, but I won't reorder this product. I will pass this order on to the niece and nephew, and will hope that in future they will come out with a reduced sodium version.",3.0

At the grocery it retails for a little more than that so I thought with the $25.00 off thus saving another 33% it brought the price of each box down to .61 cents or so which is a great savings from the grocery store and with free shipping wow! couldn't beat that.  It wasn't 2 weeks later I went to Meijer and they had the cook n serve 2/$1.00...ugh!!

I love buying on amazon (sort of an Amazon addict)because of the convenience and great prices but you do have to keep in mind Sam's Club is very competitive price wise it's just a pain in the neck going there (when spoiled by Amazon) plus always end up spending more and having to bring it all home.

7980,NOT a Diabetic Friendly Food,"This product contains Maltodextrin and so is NOT diabetic friendly. Maltodextrin reacts on blood glucose the same way as if you ingested table sugar. As per my physician: If you are diabetic, pre-diabetic or have a family history of diabetes you should AVOID maltodextrin.When I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2012, though I cut back my carb/sugar intake to no more than 20 grams per day, my blood sugar readings would frequently shoot up from within normal levels to either close to 200 or even over 200. I thought it was because my blood glucose meter was no good or something.The metformin I was taking caused gastric distress so I was on a clear liquid diet for a few days to clear that up. The diet consisted of water, low sodium, msg free chicken broth and sugar free jello. After I had been on the diet for almost 2 days, I had to go in for an additional lab. Since I thought my blood glucose meter was malfunctioning, I asked the lab to test my blood glucose and with the same blood sample, I used my meter to test. The lab test was 186 and my meter was 183. The head of the lab said that is very accurate for a home meter so why was my blood glucose so high????It turns out, it was from the sugar free jello that contains maltodextrin. It couldn't have been from the chicken broth or water and those were the only two other things I was ingesting. Later, my new physician confirmed that maltodextrin was definitely to be avoided.Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them from my diet, my blood glucose readings quickly normalized and have been normal ever since.Note that this product says it contains maltodextrin from CORN. Most people know that corn is a carbohydrate and is NOT a free food for diabetics. Because of how the law reads, manufacturers who include maltodextrin in their products do not have to count it as a carbohydrate or sugar in the nutritional information on the label they only have to list it in the ingredients.This page mentions that the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association says sugar free Jello is a ""free"" food and I don't know if those entities say that or not but it is NOT safe for diabetics and you can check with your diabetes educator or your endocrinologist to make sure but I'm absolutely POSITIVE that it spiked my own blood glucose REPEATEDLY. If you still doubt it, fast for a few hours, take your blood glucose reading, eat some of this Jello then wait 15-30 minutes and test again. I'm betting if you are like me - a non-insulin dependant diabetic - you'll see a spike in your blood glucose. How many spikes does it take before it affects your eyesight? Your kidneys? Your heart? Or before you get diabetic neuropathy? I don't mean to be an alarmist but if you have diabetes then you NEED to know what to avoid and those companies who tout their products as being diabetic friendly should have to tell the truth and be accountable. This is a DIET food but that does not make it suitable for diabetics.",1.0

8003,"Versitle, good tasting, diet friendly!","I have had the Lemon, Banana Cream and Cheesecake varieties on Subscribe And Save.  Best decision and best use of an Amazon service!  Especially, when these flavors are not always available in the store.Think outside the box.  I use this product lots of ways but my favorites are as follows:1. Buy the most inexpensive 32 ounce container of plain, fat-free Greek yogurt (or traditional but I use Greek) you can find.  Mix in one package of your favorite flavor - right into the 32 ounce container.  Lemon, Banana Cream, or Cheesecake work very well - my favorite is Cheesecake though.  Mix well.  Keep in the refrigerator.  You just made yourself a flavorful dessert.  Thick, sweet, and still fat-free!  I will never buy flavored yogurt, ever, as long as Jell-O continues to sell these three flavors of pudding.2. I buy 5 cases of the large cans of 100% pumpkin every year during the fall season when they are priced the lowest.  Take one large can of 100% pumpkin and mix with cinnamon, allspice and/or nutmeg, and one package of Cheesecake flavor (or any other like Vanilla).  You now have pumpkin 'mousse'.3. Sprinkle in a few tablespoons in your smoothie while blending.  I do the following:  1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, a few tablespoons of pudding mix and blend.  Then dump in frozen fruits like strawberries, blueberries or cranberries (that I also buy by the case in the fall and freeze).  I personally don't use ice because I use frozen fruit.Be creative and let me know how you make out!",5.0
8006,Absolutely NOT Diabetic Friendly,"I'm always appalled to see fellow diabetics extoll the virtues of many sugar free products because many of them contain a substance called ""maltodextrin"" which is every bit as bad (if not worse) than cane sugar for causing super spikes in blood glucose.Notice in the ingredients list, the first two ingredients are a modified food starch and maltodextrin made from corn. So....starch and corn (which is also a starch). The way the law reads, those who produce food products don't have to add certain substances to the nutrition information, they only have to list them in the ingredient list. Ingredient lists always go from most to least and by that I mean the first item on the list makes up more of the product than anything else. The second item is the 2nd most and so on so this sugar free jello is primarily made up of starch and maltodextrin from corn and if that wasn't bad enough, you're going to add milk to this product which is more simple carbs. There are over 11 grams of carbs in 1 cup of milk. You would be much better off to just eat a regular sized chocolate bar than to eat this sugar free product.This product might say in the nutrition information that it's sugar free and carb free but that obviously is NOT TRUE because the ingredients say it's not true. They've added food starch and maltodextrin.My endocrinologist said that pretty much everyone should try to avoid ingesting very much maltodextrin but especially if you are diabetic, pre-diabetic, have a family history of diabetes or are pregnant (gestational diabetes).The really sad thing is that much of the time maltodextrin adds NOTHING to the product - not flavor, certainly not nutrition. It is a cheap low calorie/no calorie filler.Maltodextrin is in sugar free jello, sugar free jello pudding, many sugar free hot beverage mixes such as Maxwell House sugar free coffee drink mixes and it's in many sugar free liquid coffee creamers and I could go on and on. Please, if you are diabetic, READ the label and not just the nutrition info.When I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2012, my average blood sugar was in the 290's and my A1C was a whopping 11.7!I figured out on my own that maltodextrin was bad and began researching it. Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them my blood sugar readings quickly normalized and when I went back to my physician at the beginning of April 2012 my A1C was 6.5 so I was able to reduce it to a much better level within just a few months. I could never have done that without cutting out the maltodextrin.Another bad thing about maltodextrin is it can adversely affect your appetite. Anytime you have big fluctuations in your blood sugar, it also causes fluctuations in appetite which can make it hard to stick with any kind of eating program.I've been following a low carb/high fiber diet for years now because my husband, though a normal weight and very active, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes almost a decade ago. I was sort of shocked when I was diagnosed with it and I'll always wonder if we had just known about substances like maltodextrin that react so negatively on the pancreas if I could have avoided the disease or at least held it off until later in life and I cried when I realized that all this time, I've been buying sugar free stuff for my husband thinking it was okay because his nutritionist never said a WORD about maltodextrin (and other substances like dextrose, sorbitol, etc that also react on the pancreas) and the reality is that I was making his diabetes/insulin resistance WORSE.I hope this helps someone out there. Wish I'd have known about it much sooner.",1.0

It taste like jello pudding ontop of an oreo crust....well that's because it is.Each box comes with 2 packets :Filling mix ,and a crust mix that is made from oreo cookies pounded into dust.This pie is easy to prepare. You just need milk for the filling and butter for the crust....The filling tastes just like pudding..only it's a little thicker and a bit smoother than regular pudding. and the crust is straight out oreo cookies that have been pounded into dust. You just add melted butter to the cookie dust,and stir until everything is moist. then you simply press them onto the bottom of a pie pan. that's basically your pie. jello pudding ontop of oreo cookies with butter.These pies aren't bad.

8041,There's not enough Pie in this faux Pumpkin spice mix,"For the Holidays last year, I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier. I'm familiar with Jell-O's No Bake line, such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake, so I figured their Pumpkin Pie (style) mix should be good too. Well, it's not. At first taste, I thought ""that's not bad!"", but after a few mouthfuls of it, I could barely stand it anymore. There are two main problems I find with it. First of all, the consistency is off, it doesn't really get to a Pie consistency, more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned. I've added less milk (1.5 cups) and that helped a bit with the texture (now more like thicker pudding). Second, in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin, Kraft put wayy too much ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg or whatever else in there. The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls. So now I'm stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it.  At the very least, I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O's better flavors.",2.0

And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides.

8130,Underwhelmed...,"I received a couple of these Breakfast Blend K-Cups in a variety pack and decided to give them a shot - I've always been pretty pleased with Green Mountain coffee (several of their other blends are on my Wish List) and with them sitting there in the box  I figured ""why not?"" - I'm always up for something different. Full disclosure: I'm usually a medium-dark kind of coffee drinker, and can easily drink a French Press bold brew without adding any milk or cream. Still, I can enjoy a good light roast when I come across one, and I'm sorry to say that Green Mountain's breakfast blend was simply not to my liking. I'm writing this review after having finished a cup of this coffee, and here are my thoughts as they come:It's not that the initial flavor is bad, but generally it has a strange aftertaste, tasting more like watered-down coffee than lightly-roasted beans. Contrary to popular belief, lightly roasted coffee blends are not supposed to be weak - they ARE supposed to be light in taste, but ""light"" and ""weak"" are two very different words in the coffee world. A light blend should be FULL of a light flavor, and personally I didn't find this to be the case with GM's breakfast blend.Still, reading through the reviews it seems like many people enjoy the taste, and I won't fault them for it - coffee (like wine, cheese and most of gastronomy) is so subjective sometimes that there's no way I'm going to not recommend at least giving this a try to people who typically enjoy light blends. I would, however, suggest buying a smaller count to give it a try first (or find it in a variety pack like I did). That way if you hate it, you're not stuck with 49 K-Cups to force down. If you DO like this coffee, buying this 50-pack works out to costing just a hair over $0.50 per cup - one of the best values you can find when looking for K-Cups. This blend was not for me, and I probably won't ever be buying it again, but if you DO enjoy it then the value alone makes it recommendable!Initial taste: 7/10Aftertaste: 6/10Value: 10/103.5/5 Stars overall.",3.0

8134,"DECAF Dark Magic, as bold and strong as regular Dark Magic","I wish that the reviews weren't all lumped into one. Makes discerning between products a bit confusing. Some are rating a flavored variety, others are rating regular, some are rating certain companies. I know that the actual product being reviewed is listed, but when I am looking at product page for DECAF coffee, I expect to see reviews for that product. Anyway... Green Mountain has good coffee. Never had any problems with any of the sellers. Dark Magic DECAF is wonderfully strong and bold- quite similar to the regular, which happens to be my favorite kcup of all. I often drink decaf when I need to cut back/eliminate regular for periods of time. It is so nice to have a similar flavor come through to where I feel like I am still drinking regular. Many times I have looked at the K-cup to make sure I grabbed a decaf cup and not a regular by accident. Time and time again I am pleasantly surprised by this. If you like regular Dark Magic, and want to cut back on caffeine, give the decaf a try.I purchased the 72 count Decaf Dark Magic for @$40. Great price for that many cups, and compared to what other prices I have seen and spent. I can't find decaf Dark Magic in stores, so I have been purchasing a box or two at a time through Amazon. This amount and price really works for my tight budget. I might grab another 72 count box soon, just to pad my supplies for awhile.",5.0

And I do love me some mac and cheese (even this lowfat version) in my weaker moments.Well, not this time. One of the boxes was kind of crushed in shipment and the macaroni was spilling out, so I thought ""what the hey, I'll just make it for dinner."" Ugh! Big mistake! Utterly disgusting. Unlike the reviewer who said the cheese sauce barely registered, I found it to be completely overpowering, and it had a horribly bitter chemical taste. I practically had to choke it down, and eventually I just gave up and threw it out. I have no idea if all the remaining 5 boxes will be just as bad, and I'm afraid to find out.

8461,Not impressed,"Chose this one because of the creamy cheese vs the powdered cheese even though it was more expensive. I put it on Subscribe and Save because I was certain the family would be wanting it all the time and it would save me time and effort making it from scratch all the time. Received it yesterday afternoon and made it last night for the family as a surprise side dish. It was awful. I don't know if I got a bad batch but the smell of the creamy cheese when I began mixing it with the hot pasta was so foul and nasty I had to open the kitchen windows to clear the stench out of the house. Mind you we're in MA with over 6' of snow right now piled everywhere and filling every nook and cranny available and minus temps and wind chills so believe me, I wouldn't have opened the windows and propped the back door open to get rid of the smell if it wasn't absolutely necessary.I remember having this as a kid, both powdered and creamy cheese but I sure don't recall it having a smell like this. It ruined all our appetites. Because the smell lingered throughout the house, we ended up leaving the house for a while and going out to eat after riding in the open air to clear our nostils. Terrible experience. I was thinking of keeping the remainder of the first order and making it when no one else is home to give to the 5 dogs, but on second thought, if it is a bad batch, I certainly don't want to feed it to my 4-legged babies. Out in the trash it goes and the S&S; order canceled.Must admit I'm disappointed.

8469,"Slightly weird taste, minor nutritional improvment","The veggie involved here is dried cauliflower replacing some of the wheat starch in the noodles.  It smells like cauliflower when boiling.  It has a very mild cauliflower taste.In exchange for a slightly unusual taste, the ""veggie"" version of Kraft gives you:Vitamin C 15% daily value (vs. 1% in the regular version)Dietary Fiber 3 grams (vs. 1.5 in the regular stuff)Those were the only notable differences.  An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.  The veggie version has 1 gram less fat, but that's only 11 calories worth of fat shaved from a food which is already fairly low in fat, and the total calories end up being the same anyway.  There are some 1% differences in some other vitamins, which doesn't matter.Getting back to the taste...Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese; has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.If you want to experiment with healthier noodles, there are several brands of dry pasta with omega 3 fats and added fiber.  They do tend to have a wheaty flavor, but on the other hand they don't have that weird cauliflower taste.",3.0
8471,Just o.k. with a bit of a bland taste - and actually not so bueno on the health!,"While my family is not major fans of mac and cheese I always keep a couple boxes of the stuff around for food emergencies and/or teen groups. In general we prefer the Kraft brand to other brands or generic but honestly I sometimes mix in a box of generic or two. Times are tough.We found this one to be very bland. For the amount of sodium, fat, and calories I expected far better. The veggie parts are not significant enough once you hit those fat and calorie levels to justify it. We didn't hate the taste - but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it either. Its probably a bit healthier than regular M&C; but that's not really saying much. Overall - I'd buy it on sale but would not go out of my way otherwise - and if the sale included the regular M&C; I'd buy that instead.

However, the taste is pretty good, and the good feeling of getting some veggie nutrition might tip the scales for you.Me- I'd rather eat the real stuff and a find a way to keep a few pieces of broccoli down.  But like you'd imagine, this is a great option for those kids who just won't touch their veggies, and you're not ready for a 4-hour ordeal that ends with an exhausted kid asleep at the table and an exhausted parent looking at mac-n-cheese reviews to keep his/her sanity...",4.0
8483,so not worth it,"Either I'm getting bigger (older and wiser I mean) or Kraft's macaroni and cheese is getting smaller.  The noodles I mean, not the quantity.  They look microscopic now.  I prefer to make Mueller's jumbo elbow noodles instead.  Those ones swell up when boiled and look (and taste) just like the Kraft macaroni and cheese I used to admire as a kid.  What happened Kraft?  Oh well, you still make tremendous parmasen cheese!  A pack of 15 honestly isn't worth it unless you have kids who are going through that phase where they refuse to eat any other brand of macaroni and cheese except for the popular stuff, which is where Kraft comes in.  Everyone recognizes the name ""Kraft"".  I'd avoid buying Kraft macaroni and cheese if I were you.  You're not getting your money's worth anymore, which is a shame.",3.0
8484,"Not terrible, but not as good as the regular type.","The instructions on how to prepare this box of macaroni and cheese are basically the same as the regular Kraft mac and cheese - so it's very easy. And of course it's great that vegetables are included in the pasta, making it a bit more healthy than the regular. The texture of the noodles was slightly mushier, so I'd recommend undercooking them a bit if you want them to be more like the regular noodles. I also thought the sauce seemed more bland, not sure why that was. Since I only rarely each box macaroni and cheese, and since I did like this veggie-containing alternative a bit less, I'd probably just rather stick to the regular Kraft mac and cheese.",3.0
8485,Kraft Macaroni & Cheese,"This was an item sent to me through the VINE program. The original offer stated 12 boxes, however when received there was only one box, thus my review is limited to one serving of the macaroni. According to the box this is a VEGGIE PASTA with ""1/2 serving of vegeatbles"". The word used  in ""vegetables"". However the ingredients on the box indicates there is only cauliflower in the pasta. I have reviewed every speck of writing on the box and do not find any other vegetable being used.  On the back side of the box is written, ""there are veggies in here. lots of other vegetables come right at you with their overt vegetableness"". (By the way, this is a word I am unable to locate in the dictionary.) I am under the impression that the total ingredients should be listed on the box and apparently they are not. Now for the taste test. This is limited to one serving and I frankly could not tell any difference in the macaroni and cheese. Thus we took one of the regular boxes from our pantry and cooked it to see if we could tell the difference and once again we do not see any difference between the two.If one is to expect a significance difference between the two, it did not come across to us.",3.0
8488,Mediocre Marketing Gimmick,"I'm not a believer in ""sneaking vegetables past the children,"" especially when the veg in question is in the form of pasta. While there may technically be cauliflower in it, it has none of the health benefits of eating actual cauliflower. There is also less in a package than original mac and cheese, and only two servings rather than three. Even if the cost per package is the same, that makes this product more expensive per serving.Cooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage. I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients. We got two decent sized servings from the box. The resulting mixture was just o.k. For me, the pasta had no texture and little taste, only a mild cheese flavor. Mrs. Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a ""good addition."" She thought it was less creamy than ""Easy Mac"" or the regular variety. She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better, and I agree with her.Overall there's not enough here for me to like enough to purchase this product. You get less per package than the regular variety in exchange for a ""veggie benefit"" that's a bit over-hyped. And, if Mrs. B. is to believed, one that doesn't taste as good.",2.0
8492,A thinly-veiled gimmick,"This ""veggie"" pasta purports to sneak in a serving of vegetables and as well have less fat and calories than the original Mac 'n Cheese. It's easy to have less when you change from a 7.5 ounce to a 5.5 ounce portion, which I first noticed when I poured the pasta into the water. It's a lot less than a normal box, even though the box is roughly the same size.After cooking, the pasta smells vaguely of cauliflower, the vegetable that makes it ""veggie"". Of any vegetable to choose, why that one? What nutritional advantage does it have in its processed forms? Even then, does it really matter what you choose when the chief ingredients are butter, milk, and cheese?The taste is fine, but nothing special. It's not quite the original.",2.0
8495,Tastes just the same,"I eat Kraft Macaroni & Cheese a couple times a year -- sort of a throwback to my youth when the neighbor lady across the street described it as ""good food that sticks to your ribs.""  In later years, another friend would refer to Mac & Cheese out of the box as ""plastic macaroni & cheese,"" which I understand too.Still, Kraft is the granddaddy of them all and so I was amused to try one where the pasta is infused with ""real vegetables.""  I shudder to think that people would believe that you're somehow getting the benefit of eating real vegetables that are now infused in the pasta.  How could that be?  Well, it can't.  You file that under ""processed food"" at its worst and keep going.  But, no one eats Mac & Cheese out of the familiar blue box and expects anything nuanced in flavor or texture or particularly healthy, for that matter.  That's not what this does.  So, in the context of what this is -- it's great.  In the context of making your own Mac & Cheese with al dente pasta, sharp cheddar blended with a couple of other cheeses -- or even Stouffer's frozen Mac & Cheese -- well, the Kraft variety cannot and does not ever compare.But, you all know that going in, right?  You know what you're getting when you spend the $1.29 or whatever you paid for the box and you prepare it at home with your own milk and butter.  It is what it is...and has been since I was a kid.So, enjoy.  This new variety will not disappoint; it's exactly what it's always been and what you'd expect it to be!",4.0
8496,It's Unanimous - Not Good!  Not much healthier either.,"First thing to note is this box is smaller than the normal kraft mac & cheese (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  So you get 2 ""servings"" instead of 3 according to the boxes.As far as the veggie part...the pasta has some ""enriched cauliflower"" (whatever that means).It has more fat, cholesterol, and sugar than the regular mac & cheese.  The only true benefit (according to the box) was the vitamin C difference.I decided to have a taste test with the family for dinner tonight.  I cooked a box of regular mac & cheese and a box of these...they did not know which was which.  Everyone agreed that the regular one was better.  Everyone also correctly guessed which one was the new one.  Side-by-side there is definitely a difference in taste.  In fact, the veggie pasta does have a distinct taste of cauliflower in these.In conclusion, the slight nutritional benefit is not worth the inferior taste and servings.",2.0
8499,Whole grain with trans fat,This product makes it sound healthy having 50% whole grains in the pasta however the part that everyone should be aware of is the 3.5g of trans fat. Trans fat is chemically made to prolong the shelflife of products and it is not good for ur health. Eating this each day is unhealthy due to the enormous amount in each serving. I suggest buying one that contains 0 or at minimal .5g trans fat if u must.,1.0
8500,great deal,These boxes are about $1 each in Southern CA.  I paid less than half that on Amazon.  We don't eat this too much but the 24 count box is perfect if you plan to eat about 1 box a week.  This is a smokin' deal on Amazon.,5.0

8507,Not memorable,"There is something about ""sneaking"" vegetables into people that irks me a bit.  If the goal is to eat a healthy diet that includes a variety of foods, this is not likely to ease the transition and merely reinforces in the minds of adults and children that processed food is really very good for us.  If it absolutely the best that you are willing or able to provide, it serves some purpose.  There was no discernible foreign flavor to the finished product although the boiling pasta gave off a distinct broccoli-laden aroma.  As far as flavor, this does not seem to be as cheesy as the regular version so for kids deeply familiar with the original, it may take a bit of convincing.  If boxed meals are standard for your family, choose the ones that offer the largest amount of disguised nutrition, knowing that it can in no way be compared to the flavor or health benefits of the real thing.",3.0

8513,"A healthier option, but not great","There's something off about the pasta. While much closer to the regular pasta than Whole Wheat, which is way to grainy, the pasta here tends to kind of fall apart (only way I can describe it). But from a health aspect its better than normal blue box mac and cheese. And the taste is comparable.I know this sounds horrible and a total waste of cash, but occationally I'll buy this, toss the pasta and replace it withBarilla Plus Penna Pasta~2pk~14.5oz Boxes~which is 1000 times tastier than the pasta in this box, suffers none of the high grain of whole wheat, and is chock full of protein and Omega 3's, and overall healthier and more sustaining --  because its got protein.I keep wishing Kraft would just start selling the packets of cheese powder without the pasta (they do actaullyKraft Macaroni & Cheese Topper, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)but its currently more expensive than just buying the box and tossing the pasta).",3.0
8514,"For veggies, this isn't too bad","I took a chance on this because I like to try healthy options whenever possible and I LOVE Kraft mac and cheese. I was a bit hesitant when it said it was ""veggie pasta"" because I was confused as to how this product was going to give me servings of veggies in my mac and cheese. But Kraft has pulled it off!!First of all, you have to remember that whenever there are veggies in something, it's not going to taste as good as the really fatty foods that we all love. So I started by cutting the product some slack and not having high expectations. With my first few bites, I couldn't tell the difference at all! The cheese wasn't as cheesy as the original but that's ok. Halfway through my portion, I started to notice some hints of broccolli and cauliflour. It wasn't that noticeable and it might just be because I KNEW that there had to be veggies in there somewhere. When I was making the pasta, it smelt like I was steaming veggies and I was a bit hesitant because it didn't smell all that great. But I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it. I still prefer the original with all his fatty cheesy goodness. However, if this is the only way that you can get veggies into your kids...then go for it!!",3.0
8516,Extra Money Same Taste,"Pros:Three times as much fiber as original Mac'n'cheese (3g v 1g / serving)Cons:Costs more than twice as much per serving as original.Bottom Line:Just buy the normal mac and cheese and get your fiber elsewhere.  Nutrition content per serving is nearly identical (as boxed), and as prepared they tell you to use half as much margarine in the vegi mac and cheese vs the normal, so don't compare the ""as prepared"" nutrition content as you can easily cut the butter down with the normal and still retain great taste.  The normal box is 3 servings with 4T butter, this box is 2 servings with 2T butter, so cut the normal down to 3T and you should be fairly similar.Taste wise I notice very little difference between the two, this veggie mac might have a slight vegi aftertaste, but nothing too offensive.  If the price per serving were closer together I would recommend this mac and cheese.  The difference in taste is nothing as strong as whole wheat vs white flour breads.The bottom line is this doesn't really have any significant quantity of vegetables in it, the first ingredient is enriched cauliflower pasta product, but what this means is that it is enriched wheat flour with some dried cauliflower mixed in.",3.0

It does have a distinct vegie taste, but is not overpowering or offensive. I did add shredded cheese to the mix when it was cooked as I like a more substantial, thicker mac & cheese. A purist will not be satisfied with this, but if time is an issue and you want at least a facsimile of mac & cheese, this does answer enough, at least as a snack.",3.0
8525,It's Just Okay,"I thought this pasta was just okay. I would rather have the regular kind, but I tend to like shells and cheese like Velveeta better anyway because the cheese is more real.

8526,Disappointment,"This was a disappointing ""macaroni and cheese"" product.  Sure, it sneaks in some nutritional value, but face it--you can add regular veggies like broccoli or cauliflower to regular macaroni and cheese with far more cheese flavor.  This didn't deliver Kraft's signature cheesy flavor or a significant amount of vegetables to the diet.My recommendation is to just stick to the regular mac & cheese products and have your veggies with it--it's going to be a lot better for you.  This wasn't a great dish, and far from a successful one.Economically speaking, it has fewer servings in the box to deliver that half serving of vegetables, and by the time that half serving is shrunk even further by eating less of the entire box...there's not enough vegetables to matter.",2.0
8527,Tastes the same as regular Kraft.  Be aware of smaller size though.,"This Kraft Mac and Cheese is trying to stand out in the marketplace by using cauliflower pasta.  Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.  You do cook it for a minute less than the regular product.While you may be interested in buying this in order to get the vegetable serving, keep in mind you are paying about the same price for a smaller box (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  The silver lining in this is that the calories in an entire prepared box are much lower in this veggie version (750 vs 1200 calories).This product may be useful for sneaking veggies into a kid's diet.  But the veggie amount is low, so you are better off adding fresh vegetables to a regular box of Kraft Mac and Cheese.",3.0
8534,Tastes too fake to us,"At our house we usually make our own mac n cheese with real cheese but sometimes it would be nice to whip this dish up super quick from a box.

Yes, he has been spoiled on the real thing but I think in this instance, that's a good thing. We have tried the Betty Crocker brand of mac n cheese since ordering this, and we do feel the Betty Crocker is a little better.",2.0
8540,meh,"I LOVE the original Kraft Mac & Cheese, so I was willing to give this a try.  I have to say it's a disappointment, and definitely misleading.  First off, it's a smaller box with only 2 servings instead of three, and it costs more.  The calories are comparable between the two.  Second, the ""veggie"" aspect is dried cauliflower added to the noodles and you only get a half serving of veggies in the full serving of mac & cheese. Even if you have a child that absolutelty hates veggies and won't eat them, you can get a full serving of veggies in Chef Boyardee that has more flavor and is filling.  Last, though the original and veggie are supposed to taste the same, they don't.  The veggie isn't bad, per se, but it just isn't as flavorful or ""cheesy.""Overall, I agree with most of the mid-level reviews here; this wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as the regular Kraft Mac & Cheese and the helf serving of veggies isn't worth the reduced flavor.",3.0

However, the cheese sauce has a strong sugary, almost honey-like undertone that takes away from any 'cheesy' taste - which is minimal.  I recognize this is for kids..  Let them have it.",3.0
8550,Could be Better,"It's delightful to see so many mainstream companies trying to improve the nutritional value of their products.  With this Veggie Pasta Macaroni and Cheese, Kraft has made a nice attempt in that direction with a product that has a very high kid-favored status.The veggies in question are in the pasta itself, which is made of a combination of grain and cauliflower.  It is tasty, indistinguishable from the standard wheat pasta product, and cooks up nicely al dente.  I truly enjoyed it and hope to find more of this pasta (alone) on the shelves.  It is far less tough than the more common tomato and spinach pastas.But that's where the goodness pauses while the powdered cheese sauce mix--still the original formula as far as I could tell--jumps in and loads the meal with sodium.  According to the package, it delivers a whopping 550 mg (23% of the adult daily requirement for someone on a 2000 calorie diet).  That jumps higher (28%) if the product is prepared with the added butter or margarine (I used an olive oil-based spread for just a bit of additional nutrition) and 2% reduced-fat milk (I used 1%, which did not affect the quality of the cheese sauce at all).  The calorie-count is still good at 370 for a full serving, which is half the box and about right for an adult if a salad or some other vegetable is served alongside.  I also added canned water-packed tuna to fill it out a bit so two adults would be satisfied.I'm sure Kraft could lower the sodium content without making the meal less palatable to the children it's really aimed at feeding.  If they do that, then this will become an excellent addition to the pantry shelf.  There's no denying that the flavor is great and the texture is exactly right, with the cheese sauce remaining slightly liquid without turning pasty as it sits on the plate.  Overall, it's a good start, and it certainly would be an improvement in the diets of families used to the regular Mac-and-Cheese products.",3.0
8552,"Tastes different to me, and less is not more!","When I was younger, I loved Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, easily eating an entire box myself for dinner. As I've matured, I'm now a home made mac&cheese kinda guy, but the Kraft flavor is still appealing (kind of like a Macdonald's double cheeseburger - not really a hamburger, but still quite munchable!). That said, this is not what I want when I eat Kraft Mac&Cheese - ~2-oz less stuff? Hrumph! Also, though childless, I agree with other reviewers that describing this as a method to get veg into your kid is stupid. I much preferred the, ""If you don't eat those vegetables you don't get dessert!"" method when I was a kid. It worked for me.",2.0
8558,Not a healthy alternative,"Any additional health value gained from the vegetables added to this product is countered by a high sodium (550 mg) and high calorie cound (370 calories).  It's prepackaged food so you don't exactly expect it to be healthy, but if you are going to market your product as healthy then you should be taken to task for it when it is not.  Insofar as other health benefits, it includes 15% USDA recommended amount of Vitamin A and C, but your kids are probably already getting that and then some from their morning breakfast cereal.It tasted fine and was easy to prepare, which is what you expect from pre-packaged food.  It is what it is, a quick side dish for when you are in a hurry.  But a healthy way to sneak veggies into the family's meals?  Not so much.",3.0
8559,For All Those Who Enjoy Macaroni & Cheese,What can anyone say; it's printed on the label. I have tried a lot of different brands and some come close; but for me this is the best. I have enjoyed this ever since it came out and yes that make me quite old.,5.0
8560,Pleasantly Surprised!,"My son absolutely loves Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese but, like a lot of moms, I have mixed feelings about feeding it to him. For one thing, that day-glo orange color scares me... and yet that's one of the things he loves best about it. I've tried other mac & cheese products -- and making it from scratch -- but if it's not that vivid orange, he's just not as happy! Two of my other reservations involve the sodium level, and the stuff's ultimate nutritional void.So, enter Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original. Using cauliflower in both the pasta and the sauce, Kraft has managed to accomplish the very same thing I'd been doing (sneaking in veggies), so I do feel better about this version. The bright orange color is there, so my son was happy, too. I hadn't told him I was trying anything new, but judging by the way he wolfed down his meal this tastes the exact same. Of course, that still leaves my sodium concern, and with 28% of the daily allowance in a prepared single serving, there's still quite a bit of salt in here.That said, my husband -- who does NOT like mac & cheese OR cauliflower -- also polished off his plate. In 14 years of marriage, I've never seen him do that. So whatever Kraft's up to, it's good and I'm glad not to have to make two separate dinners anymore!To sum up:PROS:1. A good dose of cauliflower in both the pasta and sauce.2. Same easy to follow instructions as the regular stuff.3. No noticeable change in taste or texture, despite the cauliflower addition.4. One less vegetable serving I have to sneak into a meal.5. Same neon orange color as your kids are used to.CONS:1. Still using 'enriched' flour rather than whole grain.2. Still pretty high in sodium (28% daily allowance per serving).3. Still that same neon orange color your kids are used to.",4.0
8561,Not as Much Extra Nutrition as It Touts - But it Tastes the Same,"If I had to choose between the Original Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and this new Vegi Original, I would have to stick with the good old Original Blue Box.  The veggie version of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese tastes pretty much the same, includes a few minor additions to nutrition, including 15% Vitamin C, an additional 5% in iron, and 2g more dietary fiber...but is this worth the missing 2 oz of cheesy goodness and the higher price tag?  Not really, in my opinion.  When reading the ingredients, it seems like the big addition is cauliflower (which is actually fairly low in the ingredients list).If you're really itching to add more veggie in your kid's diet without them knowing, this is an okay start.  Otherwise, it's not really a significant enough difference to adding veggies in your kids' diet.  I give this 3 stars for tasting relatively the same, but subtract 2 knowing that it's really all a gimmick.",3.0
8571,BLAND,"I am generally a fan of mac and cheese, though I typically go for the sharp cheddar variety.  I don't have a big problem eating my veggies, but if I can get a little extra in while enjoying some mac and cheese I figured it might be worth it.  Oh my goodness, but this was the most bland dish I have tasted in quite some time!  The noodles seemed a little more soft than those to which I am accustomed, and there was just no real taste at all to the sauce.  After a couple of bites, I spent some quality time in front of my spice rack and finally came away with something I was willing to eat.So if you are on a soft, bland diet and you need to get in more veggies then I guess I could recommend this.

Also, the macaroni in the Our Specialty brand holds up better -- it's very tender but it doesn't go flat when you boil it like the Kraft does.A good friend of mine recently re-confirmed my own findings when he said that he bought the brand which is sold at Meier's Stores (a big food chain) around Cincinnati, Ohio, and he experienced the very same results with their store brand.So, maybe it's time that we took a look at more ""off brands,"" clones, and generics. There are some really good smaller companies out there selling some very high-quality food products so don't be afraid to try them, especially when there is such a huge price difference!I hope that you find this review/recommendation helpful.",3.0
8617,Not convinced,"There are now several varieties in the popular Kraft Macaroni and Cheese line.  This is a relatively expensive (per ounce) variety.  The selling point is that it is a healthy option, as the pasta incorporates reconstituted cauliflower.  Like the other varieties, it produces a tasty snack.Macaroni and Cheese (or just 'Macaroni Cheese', as the British say) is actually very easy to make.  You just boil the macaroni until it is soft and there is little water remaining, then add grated cheese, margarine or butter, and a little milk.  Stir it until the mixture has melted and is coating the pasta, and serve.  Black pepper tops it off nicely.  Using these packets is only slightly more convenient and a lot more expensive, plus you are getting heavily processed ingredients.  I'm not convinced that including some dried cauliflower in the pasta really makes it a healthy option.Actually, cauliflower goes very well with Macaroni and Cheese.  Try adding a few florets into the macaroni when you boil it.  Then, whether you add your own sauce ingredients or use these packaged versions, you really will be getting a tastier, more nutritious meal.",3.0
8621,Tastes like any other mac & cheese.,"I hate cauliflower. HATE IT.However, this doesn't taste like caulifower. It just tastes like Kraft Mac & Cheese. It's good. It's yummy. It may not be all that much more healthy, but it's a neat trick and I think it's probably better than eating more wheat flour in my diet.It's easy to make, tastes good, and it's affordable. I'd still suggest eating some real vegetables as a side dish, but every little bit helps, eh?I recommend it. Give it a shot... Even if you hate cauliflower.",5.0
8622,It's mac n cheese...,"The regular elbow shells of kraft mac n cheese have never been my favorite (everyone knows shapes is where it's at!) These veggie noodles are made of cauliflower apparently, and I prefer their flavor! They are less artificial tasting but just as starchy. The cheese left something to be desired, but we ended up adding bacon and it made it DELICIOUS (not surprising; bacon makes everything better). Overall, it isn't too different from the original macaroni. I would buy it again, but for the most part I'll probably stick to shapes for now!",3.0
8623,CAULIFLOWER PASTA!?,"As the pasta cooked, I read the box to see what makes this ""smmmile, it'sveggie pasta & cheese.""  Cauliflower pasta? I'd never heard of such a thing. What a good idea!  (The dinner, on the whole, has two grams fewer of carbohydrates, at 47g carbohydrate, 7g sugar. I was hoping that this would be a good alternative for a diabetic friend, but it won't be.)My only deviation from the recipe on the box was using 1% milk.  I didn't doctor it with extra ingredients or by adding vegetables, because I wanted to taste what it tasted like on its own.It tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, the stuff that my mom occasionally fed us when we were kids.  The pasta was soft but not mushy. The cheese concoction tastes the same as the standard.Not as good as my friend Meem's homemade - it's not even the same category - but DEFINITELY better than adequate as a comfort food from one's childhood.The other member of my household agreed on all points, including, since ""sneaking"" vegetables in our household was never an issue, that this would taste even yummier with fresh broccoli or cauliflower in it.More Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, please?",4.0
8626,The health part is a gimmick; the food isn't bad,"The Kraft mac & cheese Veggie Pasta seems more like a marketing ploy than a serious effort at nutrition (thinkFruit Roll-Ups, which are ""made with real fruit"" but have hardly any nutritional value).  There's a slight bump in fiber and vitamin c, but nothing truly noteworthy.  Perhaps because the true veggie worth is ""about"" (their word, not mine) 1/2 serving of vegetables per 1 cup serving of mac & cheese.That said, the taste change is not starkly different from the original.  I usually make my mac & cheese with some broccoli, tomatoes, or other veggies anyway so this can be a good supplement.  I don't think the drop in quantity from the regular blue box (5.5oz v 7.25oz, or 2 servings v 3 servings) is worth the ""health"" tradeoff, and it seems most likely a marketing justification to sell you less for more (hey, it's a rough economy for Kraft, too, especially with corn and flour prices rising).Overall it seems a wash to me.  If you are desperate to sneak in any amount of veggies then buy this.  Otherwise, price being equal, I'd recommend the regular mac & cheese, with its extra serving, and just add a few veggies of your own.",3.0
8629,Don't Get Milked Out Of More Money!,"I was initially excited to see this product in my local grocery store. I love the original Macaroni and Cheese recipe.But after inspecting what this product is made of, I realized that also buying a 'store brand' and just adding more milk to that product is what produces the same increased cheese taste. And I can save money in today's ever-tight economy. This is very important when every penny counts.Given a choice, I'd rather save money for a product itself. I don't want to pay money for the packaging.",3.0
8634,Would not buy this,"There is really no added nutritional benefit to this product and to call it ""veggie pasta"" is seriously stretching the limits of credibility.  I get it: kids love Kraft mac & cheese.  Here's I used to ""sneak"" veggies in to mac & cheese: at the last minute, I poured a handful of green peas in to the macaroni.  Was it hidden? Of course not, but my kids grew up thinking that was how Kraft mac & cheese was.  It was only the occasional visiting neighbor kid who ever protested.",2.0
8639,Odd taste,"We normally love Kraft Macaroni and cheese and this was a good price, if it were eatable. I've tried two boxes but there's this funny taste like it's old or something.

8653,Disappointing Taste and Nutrition,"You look at the box and you think -- a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice. As good as that might sound, you have to look deeper at this box and the product inside.I prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box.  Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings, this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people.  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us, it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.The taste was basically tasteless. We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly.  It was salty but not cheesy.  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier.  My family would eat it and be better pleased as well.  No one liked it in my household.",2.0
8654,Okay but,This was okay in fact there was nothing wrong with it except it is advertised as Cheddar explosion and it did not taste as if it was any more cheesy then regular type.,3.0
8655,It was OK,"So, this mac and cheese tasted just like regular Kraft mac and cheese.  It does have a 1/2 serving of vegitables per cup which, is not really a lot when you think about it, but not much other nutritional value. If your kids won't eat any veggies, then this is probobly a good product for you.  I think I will stick to the other brank I like and add some chopped up veggies instead.",3.0
8657,Very Very Cheesey,If you're looking for a different take on the classic Kraft mac n cheese you'll probably love this. For me it was a little too much cheese so the 2nd box I backed it off a bit - but that's probably just me I like the taste of pasta and cheese not just cheese with some chunks of noodle as a garnish.,3.0
8658,Nothing Special,"To be fair, I'm not a fan of boxed Macaroni and Cheese, I'd rather make it with the real stuff! But I was curious how veggie pasta would taste. I cant say this tasted any better than regular boxed mac and cheese. Didnt care for it.",2.0

The case of 24 packets that I received had a ""Use By"" date some two years away, so I have plenty of time to enjoy my custard.There are two ways I like to make it. (1) Add an egg yolk to the milk/mix, and bring to boil.  Pour into a baked pastry dish.  After it cools, top with Rediwhip cream and shredded coconut, then slice for a custard cream pie. (2) Slice bananas into a serving bowl and cover with the boiled custard mix.  Sprinkle with nutmeg and place in fridge to cool.Overall rating: Yummy!",5.0
8684,Pasty Sometimes,"If you follow the directions and add the amount of water they say, it can get pasty.  If you microwave it as long as the box says, it can also get pasty.

8720,It doesn't taste like the original mac & cheese... I couldn't eat it.,"I love the Original Easy Mac because it tastes just like the boxed Kraft mac & cheese.  So, I decided to try the Extreme Cheese variety thinking it would just have more of that same cheesy taste.It doesn't.  It tastes.... different.  Unfortunately, I'm one of those people that generally doesn't like new foods.  If I'm eating a food that I grew up on, it needs to be very similar to what I ate when I was growing up (for example, my mom's beef stew has a gravy-like consistency, so beef stew recipes I try now that has red wine in a brothy-type liquid, I'll end up not liking it, because it's not like Mom's!).This Extreme Cheese variety tastes like a different cheese... a swiss-like flavor, maybe?  I think that's best how to describe it, a strong bittersweet flavor of Swiss cheese that's been aged a long time.  But I don't like Swiss cheese, because I was raised on cheddar.  I've tried two packets of this Extreme Cheese stuff, and I simply cannot bring myself to eat it.Oh, well, I gave it a shot.  Those who aren't as picky as I am might very well like this variety, though.",3.0

8725,STILL NO BOWLS / CUPS INCLUDED!,"The Amazon web site says they have bowls (now it says cups) included but you get 18 sets of elbow macaroni with a packet of cheese sauce. I bought these for work so I wouldn't have to fuss with washing a bowl. Value is okay if you don't mind doing dishes at work.  :(  The thing that upsets me the most is that the description states there is a disposable bowl / cups you can toss out. NOT!  Jan / 30 / 2013 Amazon has since changed the wording in their description. Old add said ""Disposal bowls.""",2.0
8729,Not so cheesy,"My review of the Original Kraft Easy Mac was most favorable. I did not find that so with this version. My taste buds did not appreciate the 3 cheese version. That is probably a very subjective comment, but it's all I can say about it. I had to &#34;doctor&#34; this one up quite a bit. By adding some Velveeta cheese chunks to the mix, it made taste more like a cheese instead of an imitation flavor.",3.0
8730,Eating Ramen IS a step up,"I thought I would purchase a cup of this upon happening upon it in the local grocery store. It was new, cheap, and well--I like alfredo.Since Kraft does manufacture cheese, I was convinced that this recipe should be fairly impossible to screw up. I realized I would not be getting five-star Italian bistro, or even something which I have become comfortable making for myself. Instead, I assumed it would be a 'distant cousin' of Chef Boyardee's mysteriously vanished mass-produced chicken alfredo in a can--bland and mass produced but ultimately edible pasta.If only I could have been so fortunate.The noodles tasted okay, but the sauce was THIN despite my having followed the cooking directions exactly  and not overfilling the cup. If I wanted to recreate the recipe for this product, I would put noodles in grey-yellow-colored water. Doctoring it up with meat and veggies (when chopped up to fit into the cup) will make it look nice, but it will still taste blah.Even school cafeterias, hardly known for dishing out gourmet entrees, operate with better sauce recipes, aware kids eat Alfredo in the 21st century. Surely the various divisions at Kraft can talk with each other to come up with a little better product than this?Especially thankful I had only bought my local store's one trial cup, I don't recommend this product to anybody wanting remotely decent pasta. People absolutely needing a pasta fix are much better off treating yourself to something from San-Francisco!",1.0
8734,Should Be Renamed Yucky Mac!,"I am a long time lover of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese (the blue box please). I have tried many different brands of microwavable macaroni and cheese and most are barely edible. The Kraft Easy Mac falls into the barely edible category, just barely!You receive 18 pouches with this product. THESE ARE NOT the Easy Mac bowls like you see in the stores. These are packets that you have to open, pour into a bowl, and measure and add your own liquid to. Like all Kraft Easy Mac, the best thing about this product is that it's quick and easy to prepare, in fact, that's the only thing I like about this product.The taste is NOTHING like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the blue box. This has a powdery, blah taste to it. The cheese is not strong enough to taste cheesy, but too strong to taste plain, so it has sort of a milk that thickened consistency and taste and is just disgusting. The noodles have that slimy, clumpy appearance that many microwavable noodle products suffer from. It's not the worst microwavable macaroni and cheese I've ever eaten, but it's certainly not something I will buy again in the future.",2.0

8752,Baker's Chocolate is a Rip (Kraft Foods Doubles Price),"Kraft Foods (owner of Baker's Chocolate) just DOUBLED the price of this product. There is no justification for this dramatic price increase, other than pure greed. This item, as listed, costs $4 per box. That is about 70% more than it sold for in the grovery store just a few months ago, before the price increase. The price increase, by the way, came in the way of reducing the chocolate blocks to half of their original size. I recommend that you boycott and not purchase Baker's Chocolate in protest.Edit: If the actual cost were 47 cents per ounce, that would be a good deal. But, with the $4.95 shipping fee, the cost per ounce becomes 62 cents per ounce ($19.95 divided by 32 ounces), which is not a good deal, at all.

To cut the salt, use less of the seasoning packet (save rest to flavor gravy or soup.) Use 1 Tlbs each unsalted butter & oil for creamy. Using oil alone isn't great in this pasta - if you do, select a high quality EVOO (Extra Virgin olive oil) instead of other bland oils. Freeze the extra boxes and if you do find bugs, they're dead and can easily be picked out, then you rinse the pasta and proceed. Add a can of chicken for a main dish that feeds two adults.

8840,Unhealthy Peanuts,"I bought these and the salted variety because I make homemade peanut butter. I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients. These peanuts include cottonseed oil, a hydrogenated oil. I don't know why they don't just roast them with peanut oil. Well actually I do know why: Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil.If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better. I've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg [...]which are also available via Amazon Prime though unfortunately not part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program. I just bought the last 3 cases (two unsalted and one salted) though so you'll have to wait until they get more. They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive.If you care about your health, stay away from hydrogenated oils and, accordingly, stay away from Planter's Peanuts. Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you'll never go back.",1.0

Our brand of choice hadn't changed in years until I found a three pack of Planters Sea Salt and Pepper Pistachios on sale at a price too low to pass up.My other half opened the first bag. He cracked and ate a few before saying that he didn't understand ""messing with a good thing."" He was not at all impressed and said he'd prefer I stick with our tried and true, lightly salted brand regardless of future sales. A day or two later I saw the bag of salt and black pepper pistachios had moved to his desk and noted that it was more than half empty.I was not surprised. Even though I had had a first reaction similar to his, I learned that these little peppered nuts could become addicting when I almost finished off a whole bag in one sitting. It's the pepper component. It kept drawing me back until my lips became numb.Going forward, as long as the price is comparable, I'm going to alternate these peppered pistachios with our normal, plain brand to (don't say it!) spice things up a bit :)",5.0

It really is quite a different beast than what most people would consider Spaghetti.  It tastes more like a pungent herbal version that is as to spaghetti what a veggie burger is to a hamburger.  In a similar fashion, opinions are going to vary widely and I've found that many people recoil a bit because they simply weren't expecting it to taste so different.  That doesn't make it bad, by any means, but I would suggest that you don't start with a whole case.  Personally, I find a simple dinner made with store brand sauce and noodles vastly preferable.",2.0

They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".

But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation.",5.0

9192,Yuck,I picked up a pack at the West LA Whole Foods and could not finish the first bite.  The bars had a funky taste that suggested either spoilage or poor choice of ingredients.

9200,be aware: they downgraded when they changed packaging :(,"Sadly, this is no longer the super-premium jerky that it used to be. Granted, if you're used to grocery-store jerky, then this is still a much better product. But if you've acclimated to chemical-free jerky, then the ""smoke flavoring"" that they've recently started adding tastes like, well, smoke flavoring, and not the real thing.You may not notice a difference. Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor, even when you wouldn't notice an up-shift in flavor. (Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine, and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine, but when people do the opposite, they find the tastes terrible. Jerky is the same--if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it, but when you downgrade from ""the real thing"" to anything else, it tastes distinctly artificial.)I used to buy this in bulk every few months (with a discount per Amazon Subscribe & Save), but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list, and I found that the new ""smoke flavoring"" was added when they changed packaging. So this jerky is good, but not worth the premium any more. If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like ""smoke flavoring"" I'd appreciate it, since I'm now searching for something new.",2.0
9203,Way too sweet and reconstituted texture,"I would give this really a 1.5 star, but I was generous. It is way too sweet. Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again.",2.0
9208,"decent, not great","This jerky is very moist, so moist in fact that I might not even call it jerky. It has the texture kind of like those beef-flavored dog treats you get. Flavor is OK, but nothing special. I could almost go so far as to call it ""bland"", but that would only be in comparison to other jerkies I have eaten. I prefer a drier, more flavorful jerky -- the kind you have to chew for a while and exercise your jaw muscles. This jerky requires minimal effort to chew before it disintegrates. I like the organic-ness of it, and the ingredient list is devoid of anything scary. All-in-all, it's decent, but I might not buy this particular flavor again.",3.0
9216,Adequate for price,"This is not the best turkey jerky I have had, but for the price is is worth it and I may re-order. This company also sells beef jerky, which is way too sweet and poor quality and processed. The turkey jerky is not nearly as bad as the beef. It has thicker pieces and is not as sweet. Because the price for this turkey jerky is pretty low, it makes it worth it, but it could be improved by being less sweet. It's not as bad as he beef, but still too sweet.

9224,Sugar in the Jerky,"Short and Sweet:  this jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky.  In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates.  For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.I notice that in the more ""natural"" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar.  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet.  But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware.",2.0
9231,Good cereal,"I keep this cereal on hand all the time.  I like the taste.  It is low fat, low sodium and has 3 grams of fiber per 3/4 cup serving.  I open the bag and transfer it into a tupperware cereal container.  I also take the cereal with me when I travel.  When my family eats from the motel breakfast, I can eat this.  Amazon has a good price.  I order it on the subscribe and save program",4.0
9233,GREAT cereal - previously - see update,"UPDATE 16 September 2013: Just called Nature's Path after verified problems with our most recent purchase.  I've used two of the six bags and repeatedly get ""my"" symptoms associated with gluten (yes, everyone's different).  After nearly 30 years of eating gluten free, with ""accidents"" and early lack of knowledge along the way, I am very careful before blaming one product.  Something has changed with this product.  I've slowly gone through two full bags, eating some one day, reacting that day, waiting a couple of days to ""settle down,"" repeating, and getting the same reaction, again and again.  Initially, I didn't associate my ""symptoms"" with the Mesa Sunrise, because it still showed ""gluten free"" on the bags and I've got a many-year history of eating this product successfully.  But after several days with symptoms, I realized it may be the cereal, thus beginning my ""rule-out"" experiments.  I also tried several days in a row, ""toughing out"" the symptoms, just to see if it settled down on its own (or ruled out this cereal) - no change - still reacting, whether one day eating Mesa Sunrise, or several in a row.  And symptoms subside after 24-48 hours, reappearing ONLY when I've reintroduced the cereal into my diet.  It's pretty certain where the reaction is coming from - sadly for me.  This has been my FAVORITE gluten free cereal for years - I buy it by the six bag case.I have to say that Nature's Path responded just like one would hope a company with integrity would respond.  The customer support representative told me they did change where the product is made about a year ago, but that they're still testing machinery before gluten free runs just as before, so there should be no issues.  She had no explanation for my reaction, unfortunately.  But she promised to send me coupons for all six bags (not just the four remaining ones) if I'd just scan in the remaining four bags to verify UPC and ""Use By"" date information.  That's reasonable - they shouldn't be expected to just hand out coupons to anyone that calls in an alleged problem.  I'll gladly use them on some of their other gluten free products.I really hate knocking down my previously 5-star rating, but would not want someone else that needs to be gluten free to experience what I experienced after all these years of no problems (I've purchased dozens of the large Eco bags of this cereal over the years).  I'll miss it....  I will say that if someone does NOT have to eat gluten free, this is still a great cereal.  I have no idea what other reviewers are saying about this cereal being bland, tasteless, thin, etc.  Whatever differences there are were negligible (until I started reacting).  I'm going with a 2-star rating because a previously gluten free cereal gives every bit of indication that it's no longer gluten free despite the label.  Otherwise, my 5-star rating would still stand for non-gluten free customers.=========== Original 5-star Review Comments Follow ============As I said in the title, this is great cereal that also just happens to be gluten free.  It's not a ""kids"" cereal, and has a distinct taste that is somewhat unlike any other (so it's hard to describe).  I purchase it by the case (six) of the large bags (26.4 oz./bag), and eat it often.  I don't know what else to say beyond that - great cereal, very good pricing even when compared to much poorer quality ""supermarket"" cereals.  Nature's Path makes a number of really quality cereals, and this is one of my favorites.  I give 5 stars only with truly superior products - and this one is a no-brainer.I can imagine there will be some who will not like the taste all that much (especially those used to sugared cereals), so perhaps buying one smaller box at the grocery store would make sense to ""sample"" it (if they even carry it - try a health food store or the ""natural"" section of your regular supermarket if they have one).",2.0
9234,Had to dispose of the whole shipment,The last shipment that Amazon sent to me was with the product past it's Best Before date. The cereal smelled so terribly that I had to dispose of the whole shipment; that is six bags.The cereal is actually excellent when fresh.,1.0
9236,The best cereal I found so far,"The best cereal I found so far, that is organic, gluten free, and tastes good (and one I can get at a discounted price through subscribe and save). My son eats this almost every day, and doesn't get tired of it. I just add fruit or raisins for variety.",5.0
9238,Organic Mesa Sunrise is awesome!,"We love this cereal, both parents, child and toddler!  Unlike many other Gluten Free cereals, it contains a bit more fiber; which if you are Celiac you understand why I mention that!  The fiber content is not overly high, so I would gather that it has more to do with the flax.  It is a good crispy cereal with a fairly mild flavor, which is slightly sweet.  The one peculiar thing is that even though it tastes great, the smell is not as pleasant as the taste.  This is also likely because of the flax.  And if it gets past the expiration date, you will know it... nasty odor!  That said, it is probably the best organic, gluten free cereal we have found that has more nutritional value.  Unfortunately many GF cereals seem to lack nutritional content.  Buying it by the case from Amazon, using Subscribe and Save is hands down the best deal I have found.  Hopefully someday Nature's Path will make the Vanilla and Maple flavored Mesa Sunrises in the economy size too.",5.0
9241,Used to be good,"I am a Celiac and have ordered this item many times in the past.  It was very good and was a staple in my morning breakfast. However, my last shipment was not good at all.  I opened the first bag and it had a strong plastic smell.  I tried it anyway and it was terrible.  I poured out the whole bag and went to the next one.  Same result.  Not sure what happened, but I won't risk buying this again.Update: I found out from Nature's Path that this can happen when the product is expired.  This is more of a comment on Amazon for shipping me an expired product thant the product itself.",3.0
9243,"Mmmm...squashy.  Gluten-free, though.","O.k., disclaimer:  in addition to being gluten intolerant, I'm actually something of a food snob.What's great about this:Good texture--it's like raisin bran, which is fantastic if you have adult-onset celiac and still crave raisin branHolds up well in milk.  It didn't get soggy fast.It's really gluten-free! No stomachache, etc.What's not so great:This tastes, I swear, like squash.  Even doused in really sweet almond milk and raisins, I couldn't choke down more than a few spoonfuls.  The taste, if you are a medium-to-supertaster, is beyond disgusting.This would probably be good for not-so-picky-gluten-free-eaters, but it's a bad idea for picky kids, so don't spend the extra to buy it in bulk, until your picky eaters have tasted it, first.More gluten-free food for my local food bank. Score.",3.0

9245,Love This - It's our main GF breakfast option,"We usually eat a mixture of cereals in the morning - a little bit of a sweet cereal (like Cinnamon Chex or Panda Puffs), a few nuts and/or raisins, and then fill the rest of the bowl with Mesa Sunrise.  Very tasty and good for you!  Ordering it by the case at amazon.com is much cheaper and easier than bringing it all home from the store each week.  It's like having the mailman do my shopping for me.  Highly recommend.",5.0
9251,chewy peanutty deliciousness,"I have just tried these bars and was reminded very much of the peanut butter Rice Krispy treats I make.  The big difference was that these sure are a lot healthier!

9255,Good!,"Think crunchy peanut butter vs. creamy..that's the type of peanut butter flavor you'll get.These bars are good, but not great. I prefer the other Nature's Path bars that I've tried over this variety. You're not getting the omegas like you'd get in the flax variety and it seems like more fat/sugar than it's nutritionally worth.Honestly, you could eat a 'Zone' bar or something of that sort for it's calorie/fat content in this variety.I love Nature's Path, but wouldn't purchase bulk of this flavor again.",3.0
9266,Who wants salty oatmeal?,"Maybe salty oatmeal is a British thing? I don't know. But man, this stuff is pretty nasty.If you were raised on salty oatmeal, knock yourself out. More power to you. I guess there are people who love this taste, God bless them, but I will never understand how that's possible.For our family, this was a huge waste of money.

9283,"Good stuff, but not super chewy","I tend to like very chewy jerky.  I'm looking for a lowfat, high-protein snack but if I'm going to add something like jerky to my diet I can't have all the usual chemicals and such.  So, this product is an excellent price and as far as I'm concerned it tastes great, but it's a softer jerky, almost exactly like Pemmican.  Part of the fun with jerky, and why it's such a good snack, as far as I'm concerned, is that it takes awhile to eat it.  THis is easier to eat, but that's not a huge deal, really.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.  The ""consume within 3 days of opening"" seems a little odd to me, considering it's a 1 lb. bag.  I keep it in the fridge and it's lasted several weeks without an issue.  Tastes great without all the bad stuff and it doesn't cost an arm & a leg, which is what I was looking for.***UPDATE February 2013***I got the Original and Peppered through subscribe & save every month for over a year, but I recently cancelled.  WHy?  One, the quality with this product is very inconsistent.  Sometimes it's tender, sometimes it's impossibly chewy (hard, more like it), sometimes if was very gristly. though the flavor was more or less consistent.  But when I noticed that they'd dropped the package size to 12oz from a full pound without notice, I was more than a little put off.  They reduced the package size by 25% without notice!  To me it's just not a worthwhile value anymore, and I'm tired of the inconsistent quality.",3.0
9284,"I want to like this, but I can't","No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book.  So why only two stars?  Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and theirSweet N' Spicyflavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again.",2.0
9285,Not So Good,"This jerky sounded pretty promising.It has a great price, and they use quality beef and no chemicals.When I got it, however, I was very underwhelmed by the flavor.  It was too sweet, and not spicy enough.  Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.Pros:-They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky-Texture was good, but not great-Good priceCons:-Not very spicy-Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.-Beef cuts a little too fatty.I would definitely not buy this flavor again, and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky.",2.0
9287,icky,"hard to explain why this was so gross, the texture of it was like it had a sticky film of tripe or something on it. tasted ok but felt icky in my mouth  . it also wasnt the best smelling jerky either. alot of the peices had really rough texture like there was still cartilige in it or something -and you literally could not chew it. some peices were better than others within the same package, but compared to most others beef jerky ive had, ill only give it one star.",1.0
9290,Nasty stuff,"I didn't like this jerky at all.  I read other reviews and decided to try it.  However, the bag I received was very soft and sweet.  I realize that it's called ""sweet"" n' spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all.  The sweetness was overpowering.  I prefer at dryer jerky also.  This was so soft that you could bite right through it.  I'm used to jerky that is tougher.I know I'll never purchase this brand again.",1.0
9292,"Nice flavor, but very dry","This product has a nice flavor, and no MSG or nitrates based on the label.  As another reviewer pointed out, it's a bit on the sweet side but I enjoyed that.  But, and yes I know jerky is dried meat obviously, I found this product to be very dry, a bit too dry and tough.  The thicker pieces were in fact hard for me to bite through and chew.  I'll still enjoy this jerky, but it could be a lot more tender, and I've had tender jerky made with no MSG or nitrates in the past from other companies.If you like very tough jerky, I suppose raise this to a four or five star review for you.",3.0

At first I thought I liked it. Later I thought I hated it. Then I decided that I was missing the point; ""Raw Bits"" is not about flavor, it's about commitment, it's about doing the right thing, it's about put up and shut up. Think about your Norwegian Bachelor Farmer ancestors, for gosh sakes! Do you suppose that they whined about their cereal not ""tasting good enough""?

Unfortunately, my son has balked at this super-crunchy, wheaty-tasting cereal and, frankly, my husband isn't that big a fan either. They taste very ""raw"" (can't think of a better word for it) and, no matter how long you soak them in milk, they never seem to soften even slightly.

This cereal was stale upon receipt, not so much in taste (although it was oddly bland), but more in texture. I'm not sure whether this is because of how it was packaged but I noticed that the bags were strangely thin in places. I cannot recommend this unless you like old tasting puffs.",2.0
9439,Tasty and inexpensive,"I really like this cereal. The flavor is slightly nutty and it doesn't get soggy quickly in almond milk. It reminds me of Honey Smacks without any sugar. My favorite way to eat it is with some chopped raw almonds, flax seeds and a touch of agave nectar.",5.0

There was no smell and the bag didn't appear dirty but I'm a real stickler for Quality Control. I threw away the entire case.Clean up your act Nature's Path.

Overall, this one was just 'ok' for me.  A few cubed pieces or hardy chunks of eggplant would have made all the difference.  I also found the flavor to be a little more mild then what I prefer and in comparison to some of the other Tasty Bite entries.  I could see myself repurchasing this item, but mostly just to maintain a decent variety in my otherwise lacking 'lunch' habit.  It's just not my favorite Tasty Bite.",3.0

Unfortunately, having rosemary as the dominant (first) ingredient is not a good choice. It overpowers the rest of the ingredients that are included in this mix.I plan to transition to making my own organic seasoning blends very soon, having found a good supplier for organic herbs/spices recently.This is not a seasoning blend I would buy again or recommend.Geraldine Helen Hartman author of The Groovy Green Kitchen and Not Just for Vegetarians",2.0

They're closer to restaurant Indian food than packaged, with a complex and bright flavor that just does it for me, and really comes through when served on rice.  And like all the Tasty Bite meals we've tried, they're much lower in sodium than other pre-packaged Indian foods or restaurant foods.",5.0
9499,INTENSE aroma and flavor,"I picked this truffle salt because of the user reviews.  When I opened the jaw, the aroma was like a brick in the face.  I thought that the flavor was going to be watered down, but couldn't be wrong.I read that it was great on eggs, so I took a pinch and added it to my eggs.  When I took a taste I nearly vomited. I may have added too much, or may be like the husband of another reviewer.  This may be just a flavor that is a love it or hate it.  I REALLY wanted to love this stuff, but it's just vile to my taste buds.I gave it 3 stars because I want others to know that they may be cursed with my genetic taste buds.  I envy those of you that love it!!!!!",3.0
9503,Decent truffle salt but deceptive listing,"Fine salt with lovely truffle aroma. HOWEVER, at least some of the aroma is due to ""truffle flavor"" which is listed on the jar but NOT in the Amazon listing. In other words, if you are looking for a truffle salt that isn't enhanced with artificial flavor, skip this one. The flavor is adequate, but I always knock off at least one start for deceptive practices. For this price, I doubt I'll be buying it again, although I've used and enjoyed it.",3.0
9508,truffle salt,"When I look at the label it says 5% truffle so 95% salt.  It smells mostly like salt.  It looks mostly white, with specks of dark spots.  So you are basically paying for the salt.  Like someone said I would need at least 10%.I do not like the real thing concentrated but this is not enough.  I would have to add some myself. It tastes OK if you like salt.",2.0
9510,After a few weeks it smells like rancid chocolate and burnt rubber,"When I opened the jar I couldn't help but say 'WOW'. The truffle smell was great. Unfortunately after a few weeks the smell is gone, replaced with a terrible mixture of rancid chocolate and burnt rubber.I have a deep suspicion that this does not contain any truffle at all, just truffle scent and filler, with the scent having petered out very quickly. We bought a truffle salt from Dean and Deluca and it lasted far far longer, and the taste and smell was much more prominent than in this one.Very disappointed!",1.0
9514,Great product but over-priced here,"Today I purchased this product at my local health food store (which, BTW, is not any bargain hunter's dream).  When I tried the dressing, I enjoyed the taste, as well as its nutritive qualities.  Consequently, I came to Amazon hoping to not only find it, but at a more competitive price.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  My local store's normal price is $4.99.  Howver, a (regular monthly) 10% off everything sale was happening today. Factor in local sales tax of 5%.  Considering all of that, my final price was still under five dollars.  Compare this to the current Amazon price of $8.99.  Of course I'm disappointed.Earlier comments about a high shipping price for this item seem to no longer apply, because the product is now shipped free with any $25 order--a policy I always look for!  If Amazon could arrange a more competitive price for this item (perhaps by selling it in six-packs???), then I'd consider purchasing this excellent dressing from Amazon.  Please reconfigure your pricing here, Amazon!UPDATE 10.26.10Amazon, since I last wrote, you've reduced the per/bottle price to $5.49.  I'm glad to see you're apparently responsive to feedback!This new price is no steal, but at least it's somewhat comparable to other retailers.  (Yet, I look to Amazon for super bargains, and not so much for ""regular"" prices.)For example, above I referenced a local health food store whose every day price for this product is $4.99/bottle.  For the month of October, however, that same store has this product on sale for $3.99/bottle.  I figure there's sufficient profit margin to permit a month-long temporary mark down like that.Hence, I repeat: Amazon, consider selling this awesome dressing in 4-packs or 6-packs (or any combination which drops the per/bottle price below $5.49).  In view of your staggering sales volumn, it seems kinda likely that you could arrange a price that beats the every day price of my local health store.To anyone who hasn't tried this yet, sample it!  It's a good risk because you'll likely find it to be very flavorful.  It's healthful, also.  I enjoy it so much that I tend to pour it on all kinds of foods now, in addition to salad.  (If you try it, you'll see what I mean.)",4.0
9519,Ugh - Take out the mint!,We used to drink this all of the time - for years - then it disappeared.  When I found a box I was thrilled!  Until I brewed it...Celestial Seasonings changed the recipe and added peppermint!  Seriously?!?!  So instead of that lovely bright flavor we remember so fondly you get something that tastes like liquid chewing gum - yuck.  Our family is not fond of mint teas.  Guess we are back to SV Teas until CS (HOPEFULLY) change it back.,1.0

9545,"The best peppermint tea, hands down","I never drank coffee and ended up with a collection of Celestial Seaonings teas in my cupboard.  Until recently, for whatever reason, i was drinking Trader Joe's peppermint tea--I suppose I thought it was cheaper, and it was, but it always seemed weak and i would have to use two bags to get the stomach-soothing effect peppermint is known for.Not so with Celestial Seasonings; I started purchasing this again and it is perfect.  I will never use another brand of peppermint tea.",5.0
9567,Delicate But Intense,"We make a big pot of this refreshing and gently invigorating green tea every morning. It's delicious, a blend of white & green tea leaves that brings out the best in each. I've imbibed a great deal of tea from various parts of the world, and this is an excellent, richly flavorful tea. For fun, we often add a couple of bags ofCelestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Peppermintto the pot; it's a riff on a Moroccan tradition that mixes mint leaves with tea. Enjoy!",5.0
9572,Flavor more like a meek mouse than a spirited dragon,"Although I like many of Celestial Seasonings Herbal varieties, I was not impressed with this green tea blend at all.  My personal hunch is that the reason is not necessarily the quality of the starting products, but the way in which the tea is packaged.  While most of us can and do applaud CS's concern for the environment, unfortunately tea is prone to readily absorb whatever essences it is in the close vicinity of (even the fragrances of orchids or peach blossoms carried on the wind are infused in the new tea buds as they begin to open), so if the tea is not tightly sealed, the leaves go stale and flat quickly, plus they become tainted by the packaging materials (such as paper and cardboard).  So I would appeal to Celestial Seasonings to either abandon their paper-like pouch and folded wax paper bag, or abandon tea (camellia that is) altogether, because when one deeply inhales from this package of tea, the nostril is quickly inundated not with the fresh, garden aroma of quality tea leaves, but with the distinct fragrance of cardboard.Steeped in the cup according to recommendations, the experience does not improve much.  Although the liquor is a deep, golden-greenish color, it is quite thin to the taste, strongly astringent (even soapy), flat, lacking body and character, and unenjoyable.  I tried to give it a little more oomph by using two pouches instead of one per cup, but even that did not seem to have a noticeable impact.  It tasted nearly the same!  It is also still several months from its expiration date, so that shouldn't be the problem.  I would like to note that adding a touch of sweetener and cream did help round off the rough edges and mellow the flavor out, but the liquor was still not strong enough to hold its own, and it thus took on more of a watered down character.I have tried a few other green and white tea varieties, and I should say that I'm not as wild about green tea as the fermented blacks, but there have been some that took me by surprise, such as Good Earth's Lemongrass Green Tea, which I highly recommend if you want a more robust green tea experience.  I so really enjoy that tea, since it has an immense amount of body, is well-balanced, and has a fresh, rich, playful character that embodies a warm summer day.  However, in contrast, I found this selection by CS to be quite boring unfortunately, and I'm sorry to say.  Nevertheless, it is drinkable, so I will probably finish the box, if only for the health benefits.",2.0
9575,"Avoid, a horrible green tea","I have been drinking tea for years. This particular blend of green and white tea by the folks at Celestial Seasonings is quite possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever had. Green tea naturally has a grassy kind of taste to it, but it is very light and hidden behind the smooth, sweet, and slightly bitter taste the rest of the flavor produces. I love the taste of a solid green tea, however this is anything but. I don't know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white, but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved. The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing, NOTHING but bitter grass. I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks, I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others, but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume. This particular brand is just totally unpleasing to the pallet in every way and there is no way I can possibly recommend you avoid it enough.",1.0
9579,Okay,"This is good, not too fond of the taste though; needs sweetener. I bought it for weight loss, not sure how decaf will workout for losing weight and jump starting my metabolism (anybody know?) but we'll see how it works.",3.0

9584,Disappointing for green tea,"This decaf green, like every other brand I've tried so far, is not green in color and is missing that light, fresh, ""green"" flavor of a good caffeinated Japanese-style tea.  I'd say it is actually a bit smoky, sort of like a Chinese-style green tea, which is not what I'm looking for.  I like smoky green teas, like Hojicha, but I don't like that flavor in plain green tea.  I've drunk green tea my whole life and tried many kinds from restaurants, groceries and Asian markets, and this one just doesn't do it for me.  It was surprising given the glowing reviews at Amazon that influenced my decision to buy it.  So far Stash's decaf has been the best, but I'll keep searching for better.",2.0

9605,sweet without sugar,"I like sweet foods and I add at least 2 tablespoons sugar to regular leaf tea, but this is so sweet I don't need to add sugar. I also don't add milk because I prefer the strong herbal taste and milk makes it more bland but creamy. For me personally it helps prevent and reduce headaches and stave off appetite. Highly recommended for people who want to reduce sugar in their diet.",5.0
9608,Very Unique,"The best way I can describe this tea is that it tastes like Big Red chewing gum in liquid form. I must warn you that the further and further you get into the cup, the more peppery it gets. I start out getting the cinnamon, clove and a little of the ginger and by the last three sips, it's all pepper to the point where I have to take a sip of water or iced tea. I've found that if I make this an add a bag of peppermint tea to it, the pepper doesn't hit me as hard.I love herbal teas and although this isn't the worst tea I've ever tasted, it certainly isn't at the top of my list.",3.0

9620,"3.5 million pounds, really?","This is a very tasty tea - nice and spicy, plenty of cinnamon and the ginger gives a nice bite, and no caffeine.  Every box I've gotten has been fresh.  My gripe however is the lack of strings.  The box claims they save 3.5 million pounds(!?) of landfill waste every year by not using individual wrappers or strings/tags/staples.  That seems like an exaggerated claim, and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book.  It means I always should use/carry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping, and remove them from the hot tea.  It's so annoying I even considered only 3 stars.  Mostly I drink tea at the office, and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd, so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers, which also is odd.  Individual wrappers I can do without because I drink frequently enough the tea doesn't go stale, but please give me strings and staples.",4.0
9628,Tastes like Koolaid,"This tea is good, but nothing amazing, and kind of odd. I use this tea to make iced tea. I use 4-6 teabags and use a little over a half a cup of sugar in a pitcher to make this and the end result tastes like watered down Koolaid. Not exactly what I wanted or expected. I love Koolaid, but if I want Koolaid, I'll just use the regular kind, not this weird watered down version.In my opinion Raspberry Zinger is MUCH better than Wild berry.",3.0

The mix of natural berry flavor reminded me of kool-aid--in a good way!Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

9671,Very Good - True Fruit Taste,"Never been a lover of herbal teas, but middle age has brought on bouts of insomnia :( very sad - anyway - I finally figured out that my great love of tea has been keeping me awake at night and have actually been ""craving"" herbal teas.  I tried and disliked them intensely when they were popular in the 90's, but took another try at it again a few days ago.My biggest problem with them was how any fruit tea tasted so ""herby"" to me.  But not anymore.  These teas, and I've tried them but the peach, taste like real fruit.  There is an herbal taste, but it's mellowed, rounded and in the background.  I actually like them a lot.  I am sitting here with the black cherry steaming in a cup and, again, save the slightest herbal taste, it reminds me a life saver cherry candy.  I actually taste a definite ""tartness"" in the after taste, which I love.So I'm sold.  The blueberry and raspberry were outstanding and very true to their namesake - and they smell good.

The peach especially benefits from a little extra time, after which it becomes very good and most soothing - more peach pie than fresh peach.

""Chai"" comes from the Hindi word for tea, but in the West it is interpreted as Masala Chai, Indian spiced tea. This tea is an interesting version of Indian spiced tea, based on black tea, spiced with cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper and Chinese star anise.Now, as you might expect from that description, this is a spicy tea. The different spices add up to a unique smell and taste that is not for everyone. Personally, I did not notice a particularly a chocolaty or caramely taste - the cinnamon, ginger and cloves seem to predominate. I added some milk, which helped smooth out the taste, and made for a much more enjoyable drink. Indeed, with the milk, this tea is quite interesting, and goes quite well with pastries.So, if you want to try a fascinatingly different herbal tea, then get Celestial Seasoning's Chocolate Caramel Enchantment Chai tea!",3.0

9702,"Delicious, with an interesting exotic taste","Ah, it's a definite American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is a new and exciting tea - Perfectly Pear White tea. White tea is relatively new to the West, but is an old secret of China. White tea is tea made from new growth buds and young leaves which have been steamed and then dried. Celestial Seasonings took this delicate flavored tea, and made it a wonderful drink by adding pear and vanilla.Now, one word of warning: you must be careful with this tea, as I have found that it tastes excellent with a short steep time, but quickly turns bitter and unpalatable if over-steeped. But, that said, this is a great tea, one that tastes excellent hot, and very good iced. (Some prefer it iced, I prefer it hot.) So, if you want delicious new tea, one with an interesting exotic taste, then get Celestial Seasonings Perfectly Pear White Tea. I highly recommend it!",5.0
9710,"Wonderful tea, clearly not fresh","I've bought this at my local grocer for some time and love it so I was happy to see it here. However, what I got here was stale and required 2 bags instead of 1 for the same cup of hot water. The teabags seem really stale. I would not recommend buying this tea here, especially since it ends up costing alot more (if you have to use twice as much tea). Plus you can't return it.",3.0

9717,What I imagine dishwater tastes like...,"I love tea.  I was so excited to try this, because of health benefits, as well as the supposedly delicious taste.  I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents.  The reviews were so positive, and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what.  But, I was wrong.  To my taste, this tea is awful.  It's nearly tasteless (which I do not consider a benefit in tea), but what I did taste wasn't very nice.  After one cup, I threw away the box I'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted.  I wouldn't have given it to anyone as a gift.",1.0
9718,Made me an avid tea drinker,"I believe it was in Best Life magazine that I read about this tea, and about the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea. I picked up a box at Whole Foods and from my first whiff, I was in love. Although my wife is a regular drinker of Starbucks' chai tea latte, I've never been a big tea drinker. (My brief foray into peppermint and chamomille teas notwithstanding; I was young and I was following my father's lead.) Now I drink at least two cups a day of MVR, plus a Thermos-ful at work. At first I was drinking it with half-and-half andMadhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar, but I've cut out the half-and-half. I would prefer to have at least a little caffeine, but I guess I'll have to drink coffee or black tea for that. (Lipton Black Pearltea isn't too bad, and the pyramidal bag is nifty.)So count me an enthusiastic fan. I am a little surprised at the price here, though, considering that it's available at Target and Vons for less than $2 per box.",5.0
9722,Love it!,"I've been enjoying this tea regularly for several years now.  I love Rooibos tea to start with and the vanilla is subtle and not too sweet or fake tasting.  If you aren't familiar with Rooibos teas I describe them as smelling like caramel and twigs!  Earthy, slightly toasty and sweet enough to enjoy without adding anything!  I'll continue to buy this as one of my favorite tea staples along with Celestial Seasoning's Perfectly Pear :)",5.0

Celestial Seasonings have outdone themselves !",5.0
9730,I'm one of the few that don't care for this tea,"After reading the review by ""That Chatty Gal"" I have to agree with her. I really wanted to like this tea. What's better than Madagascar Vanilla and Tea? I love both so this seemed like a wonderful choice. Unfortunately for me, the tea smelled like tobacco (good tobacco if that matters!) but had a syrupy sweet taste and no real depth of flavor. I also tried it with soymilk, honey, sugar, milk, and both cold and iced. Still, I was unable to even drink one cup because I just didn't find this to be a pleasant experience. I used about half of the box trying to make it work, but it didn't.On the other hand, my children really enjoy this tea so I think this is one of the teas that you either love or hate. As for me, I'll stick with Celestial Seasonings Chai teas if I'm in the mood for a sweet tea with milk and sugar.",2.0

9736,Not my cuppa tea at all - fruity earthy and sweet rolled together,"I wanted to love this tea. The reviews here were so motivating. I was seeking a tea I could drink daily with no caffeine, that also would not upset my sensitive stomach. Rooibos sounded like the answer. However, I absolutely am repulsed by the smell (both out of the box and after tea is infused), as well as by the taste and after-taste. I wish I loved it - I love the benefits it is supposed to have for health - but I loathe drinking it. I tried it (1) straight and hot (2) with sugar (3) with sugar and milk. All were horrible. It tastes strangely fruity - but there is an earthy taste that I just can't place that rises up and fills your senses. The aftertaste is like an artificial fruity taste, maybe artificial vanilla. Oh my it is awful. The color is quite pretty - it looks like a cup of pumpkin pie when you add milk - but I just can't down this beverage. Maybe if you like herbals as a rule that are fruity - you will like this beverage. I on the other hand love the flavor of black or green teas. I tolerate the taste of chamomile and peppermint.

Then the Hain company acquired them and started diversifying the Celestial Seasonings product line. There are now about half a dozen varieties of Sleepytime teas, including this one and another formula for kids. This version will relax you, but it doesn't have the secret ingredient found in Sleepytime Extra that will knock you out and keep you in la-la land for a good 6-8 hours. Valarian is what does that, and it's only in Sleepytime Extra. You'll pay more for the ""Extra,"" but it's a much better formula, if you really need a solid night's sleep.",3.0

It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed. But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of ""baggies"" for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.We discovered that this tea, given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely. The main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves.",5.0
9757,I love the smell of this tea and the flavor,"I drink a lot of tea and I've tried many different brands and flavors. This is one of my most favorite teas. My only complaint is that the wonderful spice flavor it's quite strong enough for me. I love the smell of the spices; the cinnamon, cloves and other spices. The blend between the apple flavor and cinnamon and spices is about equal; no one over powers the others. Other brands I've tried are way more apple or no apple at all (depending on the brand) but none I've tried have the blend of spices, which I love in this tea. I really think liking the flavor of a tea is personal preference, but If you're a tea drinker I think this one is worth a try.",5.0

This in one of those teas where you wrap your hands around the mug to warm up and savor the smell & taste. I've heard that cinnamon is good for your health & cinnamon is the first ingredient listed on the package. Great price! Packaged well, and was here in two day w/ Amazon prime.",5.0
9769,Overwhelmed by cinnamon taste,I love the strong scent of this tea and it tingles my throat after I have myself a sip.

I was expecting something that was heavily spiced, but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.I didn't want it to go to waste, so I experimented, trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied. I tried steeping it for a short period of time, making iced tea, adding a splash of milk, adding more cinnamon, etc. Nothing seemed to do it for me.

9779,Beautiful rosy-red orange tea,"The original Red Zinger formula had about twenty herbs and made a red, sour-sweet minty tea that was original and popular. The formula was revised maybe 20 years ago to a simpler hibiscus-rose hip mix and still makes a nice, red tea. Various fruit essences were added, such as raspberry, mountain berries and now tangerine orange. This is somewhat different than Mandarin Spice (no cinnamon or clove) and it's very like Red Zinger with a slight tangerine overtone. It's delicious hot, but if you like juices or your kids love juice, you can make up this tea to a rather strong brew, chill it, and mix it fifty-fifty with your juice of choice (apple, cranberry, grape for example. I don't think orange would be that good, but it might, who knows?)The idea is to cut the sugar of juices down and still have a refreshing cold beverage. Drinking this mixed with juice will cut your sugar intake and your juice bill. And it's a healthy tea.We drink it all winter long, keeping a hot water pot going and making big mugs of tea to stay hydrated and it even keeps you warm. Sipping hot, sugar-free tea keeps you from eating junk, satisfies your sweet tooth and keeps you away from artificial sweeteners, caffeine and other less-healthy beverages.",5.0

Not that I remember ever eating dirt, but that is what comes to mind when I taste it. I think this company uses a lot of raisen/prune juice to cover it up. That is the flavor that overpowers many of these teas, as well as cinnamon and anise, in some. People who like fruit cake might like it. I'm not one of them. I don't remember specifics about this flavor except that the picture is false advertising. The luscious orange flavor was only hinted at. The taste did not inspire me to try any of the other flavors, but prior to that, I did find one called Tuscany, that by itself had too much cinnamon. But on a hunch, I added it to Carnation Instant cocoa (with the marshmellows) and it was fantastic! One good thing I can say is that I appreciate the wax paper packaging. Shiny metallic paper used in Bigelow and Twinings, I think, adds a metallic taste.",1.0

The tea has all natural ingredients: such as hibiscus, rosehips, blackberry leaves, natural tangerine and orange flavor.  This tea is a ""zinger,"" distinct with  effervescent tangerines, oranges, and a bit of passion fruit  with sweet tart hibiscus.  This tea is soothing when hot and refreshing when cold.

I drank it on an empty stomach in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep.  About 30 minutes after drinking it, I started experiencing nausea and reflux.  A quick web search revealed that some people react to valerian with dizziness, headaches and nausea.  I guess that I'm one of those people.Oops.  Needless to say, this tea did not help me sleep at all.",3.0
9876,It has a very faint pear taste,"I received it today and it's okay, but the flavor is a very faint taste of pear, so next time I will use 2 tea bags when I make it in a cup. I really like pear nectar, so I'm a bit disappointed. Also the other reviewer's caution NOT to steep it very long is correct. Since I have a 2 cup automatic tea pot, I let it stay on the heat and the second cup was really bitter. I guess the white tea is too delicate to keep heated. I think I will stick w/ only herbal teas or a chai black tea as neither have ever tasted bitter to me and have stronger flavors.",3.0

This particular flavor is definitely more suited to be a hot tea. Even then, the apple flavor is very faint, and the cinnamon flavor seems stale to me.

It's way to heavy on the clove taste and light on everything else.",2.0
9978,Not their best!,"I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends.  This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea.  The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice.  Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

I tried the Lipton and other brands before picking up this Celestial, and by far I have to say I like it the best.  This is not a traditional tasting green tea with the white tea added, it's a little sweeter and a might more robust in my opinion.  And with some honey added it has turned out to be something I actually look forward to drinking now...As I said before, I am not a tea lover and never will be.

How can you possibly ruin green tea????If you're drinking green tea for the catechins then I read that this is one of the better ones on the American market (a close second is Lipton brand) so if you can gag this stuff down then at least there is that benefit (or so I read).Unfortunately I now have 5+ packs of this to use.

Relaxing, soothing after a hard day at work or in my case dealing with pain as part of my disability, just as soothing and warming.  Perfect for after dinner to settle the stomach, great for just before bed, a very good tension tamer mid day as well.  This is our good 'ol stand-by favorite and we make sure to keep it on hand summer as well as winter. It's a &#34;must have&#34; in our home, and brewing it smells like &#34;home&#34;:)",5.0
9998,Teabags are not individually wrapped,"I'm somewhat disappointed the teabags are in little pouches of each flavor that cannot be resealed. After a couple weeks all the teas are picking up the odors and flavors of the other teas. Another reason I dislike the packaging is because nothing will prevent the tea from deteriorating over time being exposed to air and moisture.Most of the teas are pretty tasty. The Peppermint is strong and gives that minty tingle when you drink it. Sleepytime is also good, a milder mint flavor than the peppermint with a hint of other undefinable flavors. My box did not have Wild Berry Zinger - it contained Honey Vanilla Chamomile instead. I found it to have a smooth, sweet taste but I wish it was just honey, vanilla, and chamomile without the other ingredients for a purer taste. Lemon Zinger is a bit strong for my tastes but that's my personal opinion; I'm sure many will like it. The surprise of the bunch was Chamomile. One of my favorite teas, it's always a safe choice when trying teas. However, this had a slightly 'off' flavor and smell I've never encountered with chamomile teas before. It isn't horrible but it just doesn't taste right to me. Still, this is a good variety and a great way to try out this brand of tea.",3.0
